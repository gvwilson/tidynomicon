:   the sequential index of a row in a table,
    regardless of what sections of the table is being displayed.

**Aggregation**<a id="aggregation"></a>
:   to combine many values into one,
    e.g.,
    by summing a set of numbers or concatenating a set of strings.

**Alias**<a id="alias"></a>
:   to have two (or more) references to the same physical data.

**Anonymous function**<a id="anonymous-function"></a>
:   a function that has not been assigned a name.
    Anonymous functions are usually quite short,
    and are usually defined where they are used,
    e.g.,
    as callbacks.

**Attribute**<a id="attribute"></a>
:   a name-value pair associated with an object,
    used to store metadata about the object
    such as an array's dimensions.

**Catch (exception)**<a id="catch-exception"></a>
:   to accept responsibility for handling an error
    or other unexpected event.
    R prefers "[handling](glossary.html#handle-condition) a [condition](glossary.html#condition)"
    to "catching an [exception](glossary.html#exception)".

**Condition**<a id="condition"></a>
:   an error or other unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of control.
    See also [handle](glossary.html#handle-condition).

**Constructor (class)**<a id="constructor"></a>
:   a function that creates an object of a particular class.
    In the [S3](glossary.html#S3) object system,
    constructors are a convention rather than a requirement.

**Copy-on-modify**<a id="copy-on-modify"></a>
:   the practice of creating a new copy of [aliased](glossary.html#alias) data
    whenever there is an attempt to modify it
    so that each reference will believe theirs is the only one.

**Double square brackets**<a id="double-square-brackets"></a>
:   an index enclosed in `[[...]]`,
    used to return a single value of the underlying type.
    See also [single square brackets](glossary.html#single-square-brackets).

    or the condition that led to the error.

    by negating their indices.

**Null**<a id="null"></a>

    See also [push indexing](glossary.html#push-indexing).

**Push indexing**<a id="push-indexing"></a>
