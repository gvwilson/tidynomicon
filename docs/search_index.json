Years ago, Patrick Burns wrote The R Inferno, a guide to R for those who think they are in hell. Upon first encountering the language after two decades of using Python, I thought Burns was an optimist—after all, hell has rules. I have since realized that R does too, and that they are no more confusing or contradictory than those of other programming languages. They only appear so because R draws on a tradition unfamiliar to those of us raised with derivatives of C. Counting from one, copying data rather than modifying it, lazy evaluation: to quote the other bard, these are not mad, just differently sane. Welcome, then, to a universe where the strange will become familiar, and everything familiar, strange. Welcome, thrice welcome, to R. 1.1 Who are these lessons for? See Wilson (2018) for a description of the lesson design process. Andrzej completed a Master’s in library science five years ago and has worked since then for a small consulting company. He learned Python by doing data science courses online, but has no formal training in programming. He just joined team that primarily uses RMarkdown; these lessons will show him how to translate his understanding of Python to R. Padma has been building performance dashboards for a logistics company using Django and D3. The company has just hired some data scientists who use R, and who would like to rebuild some of those dashboards in Shiny. Padma isn’t a statistician, but she’s comfortable doing linear regression and basic time series analysis on web traffic, and would like to learn enough about R to tidy up the analysts’ code and get it into production.

What special values does R use to represent things that aren’t there? 2.2 Learning Objectives Name and describe R’s atomic data types and create objects of those types. Explain what ‘scalar’ values actually are in R. Identify correct and incorrect variable names in R. Create vectors in R and index them to select single values, ranges of values, and selected values. Explain the difference between NA and NULL and correctly use tests for each. We will begin our tour of R by looking at what kinds of data we can toy with. To do that, we need to get set up: Create an account on rstudio.cloud, then create a new project and start typing. Alternatively: Install R. We recommend that you do not use conda, Brew, or other platform-specific package managers to do this, as they sometimes only install part of what you need. Install RStudio. In the RStudio console, run install.packages(\"tidyverse\") to install the tidyverse libraries. We will install others as we go along, but we’re going to need this soon. If you want to run the Pythonic bits of code we present as well as the R, run install.packages(\"reticulate\") and then set the RETICULATE_PYTHON environment variable to point at the version of Python you want to use before you launch RStudio. This is necessary because you may have a system-installed version somewhere like /usr/bin/python and a conda-managed version in ~/anaconda3/bin/python. Figure 2.1: XKCD on Python Environments (from https://xkcd.com/1987/) 2.3 How do I say hello? We begin with a traditional greeting. In Python (which we will show in italics) we write: print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) Hello, world! We can run the equivalent R in the RStudio Console: print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Python prints what we asked for, but what does the [1] in R’s output signify? Is it perhaps something akin to a line number? Let’s take a closer look by evaluating a couple of expressions without calling print: &#39;This is in single quotes.&#39; [1] &quot;This is in single quotes.&quot; &quot;This is in double quotes.&quot; [1] &quot;This is in double quotes.&quot; That the mysterious [1] doesn’t appear to be a line number. Let’s ignore it for now and do a little more exploring. Note that R uses double quotes to display strings even when we give it a single-quoted string (which is no worse than Python using single quotes when we’ve given it doubles). 2.4 How do I add numbers? In Python, we add numbers using +. print(1 + 2 + 3) 6 We can check the type of the result using type, which tells us that the result 6 is an integer: print(type(6)) &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; What does R do? 1 + 2 + 3 [1] 6 typeof(6) [1] &quot;double&quot; R’s type inspection function is called typeof rather than type, and it returns the type’s name as a string. That’s all fine, but it seems odd for integer addition to produce a double-precision floating-point result. Let’s try an experiment: typeof(6) [1] &quot;double&quot; Ah: by default, R represents numbers as floating-point values, even if they look like integers when written. We can force a literal value to be an integer by appending an upper-case L (which stands for “long integer”): typeof(6L) [1] &quot;integer&quot; Arithmetic on integers does produce integers: typeof(1L + 2L + 3L) [1] &quot;integer&quot; and if we want to convert a floating-point number to an integer we can do so: typeof(as.integer(6)) [1] &quot;integer&quot; But wait: what is that dot doing in the function’s name? Is there an object called as with a method called integer? The answer is “no”: . is (usually) just another character in R; like the underscore _, it is used to make names more readable. 2.5 How do I store many numbers together? The Elder Gods do not bother to learn most of our names because there are so many of us and we are so ephemeral. Similarly, we only give a handful of values in our programs their own names; we lump the rest together into lists, matrices, and more esoteric structure so that we too can create, manipulate, and dispose of multitudes with a single dark command. The most common such structure in Python is the list. We create lists using square brackets, and assign a list to a variable using =. If the variable does not exist, it is created: primes = [3, 5, 7, 11] print(primes) [3, 5, 7, 11] Since assignment is a statement rather than an expression, it has no result, so Python does not display anything when this command is run. The equivalent operation in R uses a function called c, which stands for “column” and which creates a vector: primes &lt;- c(3, 5, 7, 11) primes [1] 3 5 7 11 Assignment is done using a left-pointing arrow &lt;-. (Other forms with their own symbols also exist, but we will not discuss them until Chapter 4.) Like Python, R does not display a value after an assignment statement, so we have to ask it to show us the value. Now that we can create vector in R, we can explain that errant [1] in our previous examples. To begin with, let’s have a look at the lengths of various things in Python: print(len(primes)) 4 print(len(4)) TypeError: object of type &#39;int&#39; has no len() Detailed traceback: File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; Fair enough: the length of a list is the number of elements it contains, and since a scalar like the integer 4 doesn’t contain elements, it has no length. What of R’s vectors? length(primes) [1] 4 Good—and numbers? length(4) [1] 1 That’s surprising. Let’s have a closer look: typeof(primes) [1] &quot;double&quot; That’s also unexpected: the type of the vector is the type of the elements it contains. This all becomes clear once we realize that there are no scalars in R. 4 is not a single lonely integer, but rather a vector of length one containing the value 4. When we display its value, the [1] that R prints is the index of its first value. We can prove this by creating and displaying a much longer vector: c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 [24] 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In order to help us find out way in our data, R automatically breaks long lines and displays the starting index of each line. These indices also show us that R counts from 1 as humans do, rather than from zero. (There are a great many myths about why programming languages do the latter. The truth is stranger than any fiction could be.) 2.6 How do I index a vector? Python’s rules for indexing are simple once you understand them (a statement which is also true of quantum mechanics and necromancy). To avoid confusing indices with values, let’s create a list of color names and index that: colors = [&quot;eburnean&quot;, &quot;glaucous&quot;, &quot;wenge&quot;] print(colors[0]) eburnean print(colors[2]) wenge colors[3] IndexError: list index out of range Detailed traceback: File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; print(colors[-1]) wenge Indexing the equivalent vector in R with the indices 1 to 3 produces unsurprising results: colors &lt;- c(&quot;eburnean&quot;, &quot;glaucous&quot;, &quot;wenge&quot;) colors[1] [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; colors[3] [1] &quot;wenge&quot; What happens if we go off the end? colors[4] [1] NA R handles gaps in data using the special value NA (short for “not available”), and returns this value when we ask for a nonexistent element of a vector. But it does more than this—much more. In Python, a negative index counts backward from the end of a list. In R, we use a negative index to indicate a value that we don’t want: colors[-1] [1] &quot;glaucous&quot; &quot;wenge&quot; But wait. If every value in R is a vector, then when we use 1 or -1 as an index, we’re actually using a vector to index another one. What happens if the index itself contains more than one value? colors[1, 2] Error in colors[1, 2]: incorrect number of dimensions That didn’t work because R interprets the subscript [i, j] as being row and column indices, and our vector has only one dimension. What if we create a vector with c(...) and use that as a subscript? colors[c(3, 1, 2)] [1] &quot;wenge&quot; &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;glaucous&quot; That works, and allows us to repeat elements: colors[c(1, 1, 1)] [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;eburnean&quot; Note that this is pull indexing, i.e., the value at location i in the index vector specifies which element of the source vector is being pulled into that location in the result vector: Figure 2.2: Pull Indexing We can also select out several elements: colors[c(-1, -2)] [1] &quot;wenge&quot; But we cannot simultaneously select elements in (with positive indices) and out (with negative ones): colors[c(1, -1)] Error in colors[c(1, -1)]: only 0&#39;s may be mixed with negative subscripts That error message is suggestive: what happens if we use 0 as an index? colors[0] character(0) In order to understand this rather cryptic response, we can try calling the function character ourselves with a positive argument: character(3) [1] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; Ah—it appears that character(N) constructs a vector of empty strings of the specified length. The expression character(0) presumably therefore means “an empty vector of type character”. From this, we conclude that the index 0 doesn’t correspond to any elements, so R gives us back something of the right type but with no content. As a check, let’s try indexing with 0 and 1 together: colors[c(0, 1)] [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; So when 0 is mixed with either positive or negative indices, it is ignored, which will undoubtedly lead to some puzzling bugs. What if in-bounds and out-of-bounds indices are mixed? colors[c(1, 10)] [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; NA That is consistent with the behavior of single indices. 2.7 How do I create new vectors from old? Modern Python encourages programmers to use list comprehensions instead of loops: original = [3, 5, 7, 9] doubled = [2 * x for x in original] print(doubled) [6, 10, 14, 18] instead of: doubled = [] for x in original: doubled.append(2 * x) print(doubled) [6, 10, 14, 18] If original is a NumPy array, we can shorten this to: doubled = 2 * original R provides this capability in the language itself: original &lt;- c(3, 5, 7, 9) doubled &lt;- 2 * original doubled [1] 6 10 14 18 Modern R strongly encourages us to vectorize computations in this way, i.e., to do operations on whole vectors at once rather than looping over their contents. To aid this, all arithmetic operations work element by element on vectors: tens &lt;- c(10, 20, 30) hundreds &lt;- c(100, 200, 300) tens + hundreds / (tens * hundreds) [1] 10.10000 20.05000 30.03333 If two vectors of unequal length are used together, the elements of the shorter are recycled. This is straightforward if one of the vectors is a scalar—it is just re-used as many times as necessary—but shouldn’t be done if the vectors don’t line up nicely: thousands &lt;- c(1000, 2000) hundreds + thousands Warning in hundreds + thousands: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length [1] 1100 2200 1300 R also provides vectorized alternatives to if-else statements. If we use a vector containing the logical (or Boolean) values TRUE and FALSE as an index, it selects elements corresponding to TRUE values: colors # as a reminder [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;glaucous&quot; &quot;wenge&quot; colors[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)] [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;wenge&quot; This is (unsurprisingly) called logical indexing, though to the best of my knowledge illogical indexing is not provided as an alternative. The function ifelse uses this to do what its name suggests: select a value from one vector if a condition is TRUE, and a corresponding value from another vector if the condition is FALSE: before_letter_m &lt;- colors &lt; &quot;m&quot; before_letter_m # to show the index [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE ifelse(before_letter_m, colors, c(&quot;comes&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, &quot;m&quot;)) [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;glaucous&quot; &quot;m&quot; All three vectors are of the same length, and the first (the condition) is usually constructed using the values of one or both of the other vectors: ifelse(colors &lt; &quot;m&quot;, colors, toupper(colors)) [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;glaucous&quot; &quot;WENGE&quot; Figure 2.3: Vector Conditionals 2.8 How else does R represent the absence of data? The special value NA means “there’s supposed to be a value here but we don’t know what it is.” A different value, NULL, represents the absence of a vector. It is not the same as a vector of zero length, though testing that statement produces a rather odd result: NULL == integer(0) logical(0) The safe way to test if something is NULL is to use the function is.null: is.null(NULL) [1] TRUE Circling back, the safe way to test whether a value is NA is not to use direct comparison: threshold &lt;- 1.75 threshold == NA [1] NA The result is NA because if we don’t know what the value is, we can’t know if it’s equal to threshold or not. Instead, we should always use the function is.na: is.na(threshold) [1] FALSE is.na(NA) [1] TRUE 2.9 Key Points Use print(expression) to print the value of a single expression. Variable names may include letters, digits, ., and _, but . should be avoided, as it sometimes has special meaning. R’s atomic data types include logical, integer, double (also called numeric), and character. R stores collections in homogeneous vectors of atomic types, or in heterogeneous lists. ‘Scalars’ in R are actually vectors of length 1. Vectors and lists are created using the function c(...). Vector indices from 1 to length(vector) select single elements. Negative indices to vectors deselect elements from the result. The index 0 on its own selects no elements, creating a vector or list of length 0. The expression low:high creates the vector of integers from low to high inclusive. Subscripting a vector with a vector of numbers selects the elements at those locations (possibly with repeats). Subscripting a vector with a vector of logicals selects elements where the indexing vector is TRUE. Values from short vectors (such as ‘scalars’) are repeated to match the lengths of longer vectors. The special value NA represents missing values, and (almost all) operations involving NA produce NA. The special values NULL represents a nonexistent vector, which is not the same as a vector of length 0. "],

How can I index things? How can I access values by name in a data structure? How can I create a matrix? 3.2 Learning Objectives Explain the difference between a list and a vector. Explain the difference between indexing with [ and with [[. Use [ and [[ correctly to extract elements and sub-structures from data structures in R. Create a named list in R. Access elements by name using both [ and $ notation. Correctly identify cases in which back-quoting is necessary when accessing elements via $. Create and index matrices in R. One of the things that newcomers to R often trip over is the various ways in which structures can be indexed. All of the following are legal: thing[i] thing[i, j] thing[[i]] thing[[i, j]] thing$name thing$&quot;name&quot; but they can behave differently depending on what kind of thing thing is. To explain, we must first take a look at lists. 3.3 How can I store a mix of different types of objects? A list in R is a vector that can contain values of many different types. (The technical term for this is heterogeneous, in contrast with a homogeneous data structure that can only contain one type of value.) We’ll use this list in our examples: thing &lt;- list(&quot;first&quot;, c(2, 20, 200), 3.3) thing [[1]] [1] &quot;first&quot; [[2]] [1] 2 20 200 [[3]] [1] 3.3 The output tells us that the first element of thing is a vector of one element, that the second is a vector of three elements, and the third is again a vector of one element. 3.4 What is the difference between [ and [[? The output above strongly suggests that we can get the elements of a list using [[ (double square brackets): thing[[1]] [1] &quot;first&quot; thing[[2]] [1] 2 20 200 thing[[3]] [1] 3.3 Let’s have a look at the types of those three values: typeof(thing[[1]]) [1] &quot;character&quot; typeof(thing[[2]]) [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(thing[[3]]) [1] &quot;double&quot; Good: they are vectors. (Remember, everything in R is a vector—it doesn’t have scalars in the usual sense.) What do we get if we use single square brackets [? typeof(thing[1]) [1] &quot;list&quot; Sure enough, the value itself is a list: thing[1] [[1]] [1] &quot;first&quot; This shows the difference between [[ and [: the former peels away a layer of data structure, returning only the sub-structure, while the latter gives us back a structure of the same type as the thing being indexed. Since a “scalar” is just a vector of length 1, there is no difference between [[ and [ when they are applied to vectors: v &lt;- c(&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;) v[2] [1] &quot;second&quot; typeof(v[2]) [1] &quot;character&quot; v[[2]] [1] &quot;second&quot; typeof(v[[2]]) [1] &quot;character&quot; Flattening and Recursive Indexing If a list is just a vector of objects, why do we need the function list? Why can’t we create a list with c(\"first\", c(2, 20, 200), 30)? The answer is that R flattens the arguments to c, so that c(c(1, 2), c(3, 4)) produces c(1, 2, 3, 4). It also does automatic type conversion: c(\"first\", c(2, 20, 200), 30) produces a vector of character strings c(\"first\", \"2\", \"20\", \"200\", \"30\"). This is helpful once you get used to it. Another “helpful, ish” behavior is that using [[ with a list subsets recursively: if thing &lt;- list(a = list(b = list(c = list(d = 1)))), then thing[[c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\")]] selects the 1. 3.5 How can I access elements by name? R allows us to name the elements in vectors: if we assign c(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3) to names, then names[\"two\"] is 2. We can use this to create a lookup table: values &lt;- c(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;nb&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) lookup &lt;- c(m = &quot;Male&quot;, f = &quot;Female&quot;, nb = &quot;Non-binary&quot;) lookup[values] m f nb f f &quot;Male&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Non-binary&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; m m &quot;Male&quot; &quot;Male&quot; If the structure in question is a list rather than an atomic vector of numbers, characters, or logicals, we can use the syntax lookup$m instead of lookup[\"m\"]: lookup_list &lt;- list(m = &quot;Male&quot;, f = &quot;Female&quot;, nb = &quot;Non-binary&quot;) lookup_list$m [1] &quot;Male&quot; We will explore this in more detail when we look at the tidyverse in Chapter 5, since that is where access-by-name is used most often. For now, simply note that if the name of an element isn’t a legal variable name, we have to put it in backward quotes to use it as an accessor: another_list &lt;- list(&quot;first field&quot; = &quot;F&quot;, &quot;second field&quot; = &quot;S&quot;) another_list$`first field` [1] &quot;F&quot; Wherever possible, it’s better to choose names that don’t require back-quoting, such as first_field. 3.6 How can I create and index a matrix? Matrices are frequently used in statistics, so R provides built-in support for them. After a &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3), a is a 3x3 matrix containing the values 1 through 9. What may surprise you is the order in which the values generated by the expression 1:9 are laid out: a &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3) a [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 4 7 [2,] 2 5 8 [3,] 3 6 9 Under the hood, a matrix is a vector with an attribute called dim that stores its dimensions: dim(a) [1] 3 3 a[3, 3] is a vector of length 1 containing the value 9 (again, “scalars” in R are actually vectors), while a[1,] is the vector c(1, 4, 7) (because we are selecting the first row of the matrix) and a[,1] is the vector c(1, 2, 3) (because we are selecting the first column of the matrix). Elements can still be accessed using a single index, which returns the value from that location in the underlying vector: a[8] [1] 8 3.7 Key Points A list is a heterogeneous vector capable of storing values of any type (including other lists). Indexing with [ returns a structure of the same type as the structure being indexed (e.g., returns a list when applied to a list). Indexing with [[ strips away one level of structure (i.e., returns the indicated element without any wrapping). Use list('name' = value, ...) to name the elements of a list. Use either L['name'] or L$name to access elements by name. Use back-quotes around the name with $ notation if the name is not a legal R variable name. Use matrix(values, nrow = N) to create a matrix with N rows containing the given values. Use m[i, j] to get the value at the i’th row and j’th column of a matrix. Use m[i,] to get a vector containing the values in the i’th row of a matrix. Use m[,j] to get a vector containing the values in the j’th column of a matrix. "],

What should I use instead of loops in R? How do ranges in R differ from ranges in Python? How do I create functions in R? 4.2 Learning Objectives Create for loops and if/else statements in R. Explain why vectors cannot be used directly in conditional expressions and correctly use all and any to combine their values. Define functions taking a fixed number of named arguments and/or a variable number of arguments. Explain what vectorization is and create vectorized equivalents of unnested loops containing simple conditional tests. Chapter 2 said that modern R strongly encourages people to write vectorized code. There are times, though, when we need to write loops and conditionals, and we should always break our code up into single-purpose functions. 4.3 How do I choose and repeat things? We cherish the illusion of free will so much that we embed a pretense of it in our machines in the form of conditional statements using if and else. (Ironically, we then instruct those same machines to make the same decisions over and over. It’s no wonder they sometimes appear mad…) Here, for example, is a snippet of Python that displays the signs of a list of numbers: values = [-15, 0, 15] for v in values: if v &lt; 0: sign = -1 elif v == 0: sign = 0 else: sign = 1 print(&quot;The sign of&quot;, v, &quot;is&quot;, sign) The sign of -15 is -1 The sign of 0 is 0 The sign of 15 is 1 Its direct translation into R is: values &lt;- c(-1, 0, 1) for (v in values) { if (v &lt; 0) { sign &lt;- -1 } else if (v == 0) { sign &lt;- 0 } else { sign &lt;- 1 } print(glue::glue(&quot;The sign of {v} is {sign}&quot;)) } The sign of -1 is -1 The sign of 0 is 0 The sign of 1 is 1 print(glue::glue(&quot;The final value of v is {v}&quot;)) The final value of v is 1 There are a few things to note here: This is not how we should write R: everything in this snippet can and should be vectorized. The parentheses in the loop header are required: we cannot simply write for v in values. The curly braces around the body of the loop and around the bodies of the conditional branches are optional, since each contains only a single statement. However, they should always be there to help readability. The loop variable v persists after the loop is over. glue::glue (the function glue from the library of the same name) interpolates variables into strings in sensible ways. We will load this library and use plain old glue in the explanations that follow. (Note that R uses :: to get functions out of packages rather than Python’s ..) By calling our temporary variable sign we have accidentally overwritten the rather useful built-in R function with that name. Name collisions of this sort are as easy in R as they are in Python. 4.4 How can I express a range of values in R? By default, R’s for loop gives us the values in a vector, just as Python’s does. If we want to loop over the indices instead, we can use the function seq_along: colors = c(&quot;eburnean&quot;, &quot;glaucous&quot;, &quot;wenge&quot;) for (i in seq_along(colors)) { print(glue(&quot;The length of color {i} is {length(colors[i])}&quot;)) } The length of color 1 is 1 The length of color 2 is 1 The length of color 3 is 1 This output makes no sense until we remember that every value is a vector, and that length returns the length of a vector, so that length(colors[0]) is telling us that colors[0] contains one element. If we want the number of characters in the strings, we can use R’s built-in nchar or the more modern function stringr::str_length: for (i in seq_along(colors)) { print(glue(&quot;The length of color {i} is {stringr::str_length(colors[i])}&quot;)) } The length of color 1 is 8 The length of color 2 is 8 The length of color 3 is 5 seq_along returns a vector containing a sequence of integers: seq_along(colors) [1] 1 2 3 Since sequences of this kind are used frequently, R lets us write them using range expressions like this: 5:10 [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 Their most common use is as indices to vectors: colors &lt;- c(&quot;eburnean&quot;, &quot;glaucous&quot;, &quot;squamous&quot;, &quot;wenge&quot;) colors[1:3] [1] &quot;eburnean&quot; &quot;glaucous&quot; &quot;squamous&quot; We can similarly subtract a range of colors by index: colors[-1:-3] [1] &quot;wenge&quot; However, R does not allow tripartite expressions of the form start:end:stride. For that, we must use the seq function: seq(1, 10, 3) [1] 1 4 7 10 This example also shows that ranges in R are inclusive at both ends, i.e., they run up to and including the upper bound. As is traditional among programming language advocates, people claim that this is more natural and then cite some supportive anecdote as proof. Repeating Things The function rep repeats things, so rep(\"a\", 3) is c(\"a\", \"a\", \"a\"). If the second argument is a vector of the same length as the first, it specifies how many times each item in the first vector is to be repeated: rep(c(\"a\", \"b\"), c(2, 3)) is c(\"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\"). 4.5 How can I use a vector in a conditional statement? We cannot use vectors directly as a condition in an if statement: numbers &lt;- c(0, 1, 2) if (numbers) { print(&quot;This should not work.&quot;) } Warning in if (numbers) {: the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used Instead, we must collapse the vector into a single logical value. numbers &lt;- c(0, 1, 2) if (all(numbers &gt;= 0)) { print(&quot;This, on the other hand, should work.&quot;) } [1] &quot;This, on the other hand, should work.&quot; The function all returns TRUE if every element in its argument is TRUE; it corresponds to a logical “and” of all its inputs. We can use a corresponding function any to check if at least one value is TRUE, which corresponds to a logical “or” across the whole input. 4.6 How do I create and call functions? As we have already seen, we call functions in R much as we do in Python: max(1, 3, 5) + min(1, 3, 5) [1] 6 We define a new function using the function keyword. This creates the function, but does not name it; to accomplish that, we must assign the newly-created function to a variable: swap &lt;- function(pair) { c(pair[2], pair[1]) } swap(c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;)) [1] &quot;right&quot; &quot;left&quot; As this example shows, the result of a function is the value of the last expression evaluated within it. A function can return a value earlier using the return function; we can use return for the final value as well, but most R programmers do not. swap &lt;- function(pair) { if (length(pair) != 2) { return(NULL) # This is very bad practice. } c(pair[2], pair[1]) } swap(c(&quot;one&quot;)) NULL swap(c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;)) [1] &quot;right&quot; &quot;left&quot; Returning NULL when our function’s inputs are invalid as we have done above is foolhardy, as doing so means that swap can fail without telling us that it has done so. Consider: NULL[1] # Try to access an element of the vector that does not exist. NULL values &lt;- 5:10 # More than two values. result &lt;- swap(values) # Attempting to swap the values produces NULL. result[1] # But we can operate on the result without error. NULL We will look at what we should do instead in Chapter 7. 4.7 How can I write a function that takes a varying number of arguments? If the number of arguments given to a function is not the number expected, R complains: swap(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;) Error in swap(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;): unused arguments (&quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;) (Note that in this example we as passing three values, not a single vector containing three values.) If we want a function to handle a varying number of arguments, we represent the “extra” arguments with an ellipsis ... (three dots), which serves the same purpose as Python’s *args: print_with_title &lt;- function(title, ...) { print(glue(&quot;=={title}==&quot;), paste(..., sep = &quot;\\n&quot;)) } print_with_title(&quot;to-do&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;) ==to-do== Monday Tuesday Wednesday (The function paste combines multiple arguments with the specified separator.) R has a special data structure to represent the extra arguments in .... If we want to work with those arguments one by one, we must convert ... to a list: add &lt;- function(...) { result &lt;- 0 for (value in list(...)) { result &lt;- result + value } result } add(1, 3, 5, 7) [1] 16 4.8 How can I provide default values for arguments? Like Python and most other modern programming languages, R lets us define default values for arguments and then pass arguments by name: example &lt;- function(first, second = &quot;second&quot;, third = &quot;third&quot;) { print(glue(&quot;first=&#39;{first}&#39; second=&#39;{second}&#39; third=&#39;{third}&#39;&quot;)) } example(&quot;with just first&quot;) first=&#39;with just first&#39; second=&#39;second&#39; third=&#39;third&#39; example(&quot;with first and second by position&quot;, &quot;positional&quot;) first=&#39;with first and second by position&#39; second=&#39;positional&#39; third=&#39;third&#39; example(&quot;with first and third by name&quot;, third = &quot;by name&quot;) first=&#39;with first and third by name&#39; second=&#39;second&#39; third=&#39;by name&#39; One caution: when you use a name in a function call, R ignores non-function objects when figuring out what function to call. For example, the call orange() in the code below produces 110 because purple(purple) is interpreted as “pass the value of the local variable purple into the globally-defined function purple”: purple &lt;- function(x) x + 100 orange &lt;- function() { purple &lt;- 10 purple(purple) } orange() [1] 110 4.9 How can I hide the value that R returns? If the value returned by a function isn’t assigned to something, R will print it out. This usually isn’t what we want in library functions, so we can use the function invisible to mark a value so that it won’t be printed by default (but can still be assigned). This allows us to convert this: something &lt;- function(value) { 10 * value } something(2) [1] 20 to this: something &lt;- function(value) { invisible(10 * value) } something(2) The calculation is still done, but the output is suppressed. 4.10 How can I assign to a global variable from inside a function? The assignment operator &lt;&lt;- means “assign to a variable outside the current scope”. As the example below shows, this means that what looks like creation of a new local variable can actually be modification of a global one: var &lt;- &quot;original value&quot; demonstrate &lt;- function() { var &lt;&lt;- &quot;new value&quot; } demonstrate() var [1] &quot;new value&quot; This should only and always be done with care: modern R strongly encourages a functional style of programming in which functions do not modify their input data, and nobody thinks that modifying global variables is a good idea any more. 4.11 Key Points Use for (loop_variable in collection){ ...body... } to create a loop. Use if (expression) { ...body... } else if (expression) { ...body... } else { ...body... } to create conditionals. Expression conditions must have length 1; use any(...) and all(...) to collapse logical vectors to single values. Use function(...arguments...) { ...body... } to create a function. Use variable &lt;- function(…arguments…) { …body… }` to create a function and give it a name. The body of a function can be a single expression or a block in curly braces. The last expression evaluated in a function is returned as its result. Use return(expression) to return a result early from a function. "],

There is no point in becoming fluent in Enochian if you do not then call forth a Dweller Beneath at the time of the new moon. Similarly, there is no point learning a language designed for data manipulation if you do not then bend data to your will. This chapter therefore looks at how to do the things that R was summoned—er, designed—to do. 5.3 How do I read data? We begin by looking at the file tidy/infant_hiv.csv, a tidied version of data on the percentage of infants born to women with HIV who received an HIV test themselves within two months of birth. The original data comes from the UNICEF site at https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/hiv-aids-statistical-tables/, and this file contains: country,year,estimate,hi,lo AFG,2009,NA,NA,NA AFG,2010,NA,NA,NA ... AFG,2017,NA,NA,NA AGO,2009,NA,NA,NA AGO,2010,0.03,0.04,0.02 AGO,2011,0.05,0.07,0.04 AGO,2012,0.06,0.08,0.05 ... ZWE,2016,0.71,0.88,0.62 ZWE,2017,0.65,0.81,0.57 The actual file has many more rows (and no ellipses). It uses NA to show missing data rather than (for example) -, a space, or a blank, and its values are interpreted as follows: Header Datatype Description country char ISO3 country code of country reporting data year integer year CE for which data reported estimate double/NA estimated percentage of measurement hi double/NA high end of range lo double/NA low end of range We can load this data in Python like this: import pandas as pd infant_hiv = pd.read_csv(&#39;tidy/infant_hiv.csv&#39;) print(infant_hiv) country year estimate hi lo 0 AFG 2009 NaN NaN NaN 1 AFG 2010 NaN NaN NaN 2 AFG 2011 NaN NaN NaN 3 AFG 2012 NaN NaN NaN 4 AFG 2013 NaN NaN NaN 5 AFG 2014 NaN NaN NaN 6 AFG 2015 NaN NaN NaN 7 AFG 2016 NaN NaN NaN 8 AFG 2017 NaN NaN NaN ... The equivalent in R is to load the tidyverse collection of libraries and then call the read_csv function. We will go through this in stages, since each produces output. library(tidyverse) Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called &#39;tidyverse&#39; Ah. We must install this, which we only need to do once per machine: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) We then load the library once per program: library(tidyverse) ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ── ✔ ggplot2 3.1.0 ✔ purrr 0.3.0 ✔ tibble 2.0.1 ✔ dplyr 0.7.8 ✔ tidyr 0.8.2 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ✔ readr 1.1.1 ✔ forcats 0.3.0 ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() Warning messages: 1: package ‘tibble’ was built under R version 3.5.2 2: package ‘purrr’ was built under R version 3.5.2 3: package ‘stringr’ was built under R version 3.5.2 Note that to install, we give install.packages a string, but to use, we simply give the name of the library we want. Asking for the tidyverse gives us eight libraries (or packages). One of those, dplyr, defines two functions that mask standard functions in R with the same names. This is deliberate, and if we need the originals, we can get them with their fully-qualified names stats::filter and stats::lag. Once we have the tidyverse loaded, reading the file looks remarkably like reading the file: infant_hiv &lt;- read_csv(&#39;tidy/infant_hiv.csv&#39;) Parsed with column specification: cols( country = col_character(), year = col_integer(), estimate = col_double(), hi = col_double(), lo = col_double() ) R’s read_csv tells us more about what it has done than Pandas does. In particular, it guesses the data types of columns based on the first thousand values and then tells us what types it has inferred. (In a better universe, people would habitually use the first two rows of their spreadsheets for name and units, but we do not live there.) We can now look at what read_csv has produced. infant_hiv # A tibble: 1,728 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 AFG 2009 NA NA NA 2 AFG 2010 NA NA NA 3 AFG 2011 NA NA NA 4 AFG 2012 NA NA NA 5 AFG 2013 NA NA NA 6 AFG 2014 NA NA NA 7 AFG 2015 NA NA NA 8 AFG 2016 NA NA NA 9 AFG 2017 NA NA NA 10 AGO 2009 NA NA NA # … with 1,718 more rows This is a tibble, which is the tidyverse’s enhanced version of R’s data.frame. It organizes data into named columns, each having one value for each row. 5.4 How do I inspect data? We often have a quick look at the content of a table to remind ourselves what it contains. Pandas does this using methods whose names are borrowed from the Unix shell’s head and tail commands: print(infant_hiv.head()) country year estimate hi lo 0 AFG 2009 NaN NaN NaN 1 AFG 2010 NaN NaN NaN 2 AFG 2011 NaN NaN NaN 3 AFG 2012 NaN NaN NaN 4 AFG 2013 NaN NaN NaN print(infant_hiv.tail()) country year estimate hi lo 1723 ZWE 2013 0.57 0.70 0.49 1724 ZWE 2014 0.54 0.67 0.47 1725 ZWE 2015 0.59 0.73 0.51 1726 ZWE 2016 0.71 0.88 0.62 1727 ZWE 2017 0.65 0.81 0.57 R has similarly-named functions (not methods): head(infant_hiv) # A tibble: 6 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 AFG 2009 NA NA NA 2 AFG 2010 NA NA NA 3 AFG 2011 NA NA NA 4 AFG 2012 NA NA NA 5 AFG 2013 NA NA NA 6 AFG 2014 NA NA NA tail(infant_hiv) # A tibble: 6 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ZWE 2012 0.38 0.47 0.33 2 ZWE 2013 0.570 0.7 0.49 3 ZWE 2014 0.54 0.67 0.47 4 ZWE 2015 0.59 0.73 0.51 5 ZWE 2016 0.71 0.88 0.62 6 ZWE 2017 0.65 0.81 0.570 Let’s have a closer look at that last command’s output: tail(infant_hiv) # A tibble: 6 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ZWE 2012 0.38 0.47 0.33 2 ZWE 2013 0.570 0.7 0.49 3 ZWE 2014 0.54 0.67 0.47 4 ZWE 2015 0.59 0.73 0.51 5 ZWE 2016 0.71 0.88 0.62 6 ZWE 2017 0.65 0.81 0.570 Note that the row numbers printed by tail are relative to the output, not absolute to the table. This is different from Pandas, which retains the original row numbers. What about overall information? print(infant_hiv.info()) &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 1728 entries, 0 to 1727 Data columns (total 5 columns): country 1728 non-null object year 1728 non-null int64 estimate 728 non-null float64 hi 728 non-null float64 lo 728 non-null float64 dtypes: float64(3), int64(1), object(1) memory usage: 67.6+ KB None summary(infant_hiv) country year estimate hi Length:1728 Min. :2009 Min. :0.000 Min. :0.0000 Class :character 1st Qu.:2011 1st Qu.:0.100 1st Qu.:0.1400 Mode :character Median :2013 Median :0.340 Median :0.4350 Mean :2013 Mean :0.387 Mean :0.4614 3rd Qu.:2015 3rd Qu.:0.620 3rd Qu.:0.7625 Max. :2017 Max. :0.950 Max. :0.9500 NA&#39;s :1000 NA&#39;s :1000 lo Min. :0.0000 1st Qu.:0.0800 Median :0.2600 Mean :0.3221 3rd Qu.:0.5100 Max. :0.9500 NA&#39;s :1000 Your display of R’s summary may or may not wrap, depending on how large a screen the older acolytes have allowed you. 5.5 How do I index rows and columns? A Pandas DataFrame is a collection of series (also called columns), each containing the values of a single observed variable: print(infant_hiv[&#39;estimate&#39;]) 0 NaN 1 NaN 2 NaN 3 NaN 4 NaN 5 NaN 6 NaN 7 NaN 8 NaN 9 NaN 10 0.03 11 0.05 12 0.06 13 0.15 14 0.10 15 0.06 16 0.01 17 0.01 18 NaN 19 NaN ... We would get exactly the same output in Python with infant_hiv.estimate, i.e., with an attribute name rather than a string subscript. The same tricks work in R: infant_hiv[&#39;estimate&#39;] # A tibble: 1,728 x 1 estimate &lt;dbl&gt; 1 NA 2 NA 3 NA 4 NA 5 NA 6 NA 7 NA 8 NA 9 NA 10 NA # … with 1,718 more rows However, R’s infant_hiv$estimate provides all the data: infant_hiv$estimate [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 0.03 0.05 0.06 [14] 0.15 0.10 0.06 0.01 0.01 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [27] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [40] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 0.13 0.12 0.12 0.52 0.53 [53] 0.67 0.66 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [66] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [79] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 0.26 [92] 0.24 0.38 0.55 0.61 0.74 0.83 0.75 0.74 NA 0.10 0.10 0.11 0.18 [105] 0.12 0.02 0.12 0.20 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [118] NA NA 0.10 0.09 0.12 0.26 0.27 0.25 0.32 0.03 0.09 0.13 0.19 [131] 0.25 0.30 0.28 0.15 0.16 NA 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.15 0.10 0.17 [144] 0.14 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [157] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [170] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 0.95 0.95 [183] 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.80 0.95 0.87 0.77 0.75 0.72 0.51 0.55 0.50 [196] 0.62 0.37 0.36 0.07 0.46 0.46 0.46 0.46 0.44 0.43 0.42 0.40 0.25 [209] 0.25 0.46 0.25 0.45 0.45 0.46 0.46 0.45 NA NA NA NA NA [222] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [235] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 0.53 0.35 0.36 [248] 0.48 0.41 0.45 0.47 0.50 0.01 0.01 0.07 0.05 0.03 0.09 0.12 0.21 ... Again, note that the boxed number on the left is the start index of that row. What about single values? Remembering to count from zero from Python and as humans do for R, we have: print(infant_hiv.estimate[11]) 0.05 infant_hiv$estimate[12] [1] 0.05 Ah—everything in R is a vector, so we get a vector of one value as an output rather than a single value. print(len(infant_hiv.estimate[11])) TypeError: object of type &#39;numpy.float64&#39; has no len() Detailed traceback: File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; length(infant_hiv$estimate[12]) [1] 1 And yes, ranges work: print(infant_hiv.estimate[5:15]) 5 NaN 6 NaN 7 NaN 8 NaN 9 NaN 10 0.03 11 0.05 12 0.06 13 0.15 14 0.10 Name: estimate, dtype: float64 infant_hiv$estimate[6:15] [1] NA NA NA NA NA 0.03 0.05 0.06 0.15 0.10 Note that the upper bound is the same, because it’s inclusive in R and exclusive in Python. Note also that neither library prevents us from selecting a range of data that spans logical groups such as countries, which is why selecting by row number is usually a sign of innocence, insouciance, or desperation. We can select by column number as well. Pandas uses the rather clumsy object.iloc[rows, columns], with the usual : shortcut for “entire range”: print(infant_hiv.iloc[:, 0]) 0 AFG 1 AFG 2 AFG 3 AFG 4 AFG 5 AFG 6 AFG 7 AFG 8 AFG 9 AGO 10 AGO 11 AGO 12 AGO 13 AGO 14 AGO 15 AGO 16 AGO 17 AGO 18 AIA 19 AIA ... Since this is a column, it can be indexed: print(infant_hiv.iloc[:, 0][0]) AFG In R, a single index is interpreted as the column index: infant_hiv[1] # A tibble: 1,728 x 1 country &lt;chr&gt; 1 AFG 2 AFG 3 AFG 4 AFG 5 AFG 6 AFG 7 AFG 8 AFG 9 AFG 10 AGO # … with 1,718 more rows But notice that the output is not a vector, but another tibble (i.e., a table with N rows and one column). This means that adding another index does column-wise indexing on that tibble: infant_hiv[1][1] # A tibble: 1,728 x 1 country &lt;chr&gt; 1 AFG 2 AFG 3 AFG 4 AFG 5 AFG 6 AFG 7 AFG 8 AFG 9 AFG 10 AGO # … with 1,718 more rows How then are we to get the first mention of Afghanistan? The answer is to use double square brackets to strip away one level of structure: infant_hiv[[1]] [1] &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; [12] &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; [23] &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; [34] &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; [45] &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; [56] &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; [67] &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; [78] &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; [89] &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; [100] &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; [111] &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; [122] &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; [133] &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; [144] &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; [155] &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; [166] &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; [177] &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; [188] &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; [199] &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; [210] &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRB&quot; &quot;BRB&quot; &quot;BRB&quot; &quot;BRB&quot; ... This is now a plain old vector, so it can be indexed with single square brackets: infant_hiv[[1]][1] [1] &quot;AFG&quot; But that too is a vector, so it can of course be indexed as well (for some value of “of course”): infant_hiv[[1]][1][1] [1] &quot;AFG&quot; Thus, data[1][[1]] produces a tibble, then selects the first column vector from it, so it still gives us a vector. This is not madness. It is merely…differently sane. Subsetting data frames: When we are working with data frames (including tibbles), subsetting with a single vector selects columns, not rows, because data frames are stored as lists of columns. This means that df[1:2] selects two columns from df. However, in df[2:3, 1:2], the first index selects rows, while the second selects columns. 5.6 How do I calculate basic statistics? What is the average estimate? We start by grabbing that column for convenience: estimates = infant_hiv.estimate print(len(estimates)) 1728 print(estimates.mean()) 0.3870192307692308 This translates almost directly to R: estimates &lt;- infant_hiv$estimate length(estimates) [1] 1728 mean(estimates) [1] NA The void is always there, waiting for us… Let’s fix this in R first by telling mean to drop NAs: mean(estimates, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 0.3870192 And then try to get the statistically correct behavior in Pandas: print(estimates.mean(skipna=False)) nan Many functions in R use na.rm to control whether NAs are removed or not. (Remember, the . character is just another part of the name) R’s default behavior is to leave NAs in, and then to include them in aggregate computations. Python’s is to get rid of missing values early and work with what’s left, which makes translating code from one language to the next much more interesting than it might otherwise be. But other than that, the statistics works the same way in Python: print(&quot;min&quot;, estimates.min()) min 0.0 print(&quot;max&quot;, estimates.max()) max 0.95 print(&quot;std&quot;, estimates.std()) std 0.3034511074214113 Here are the equivalent computations in R: print(glue(&quot;min {min(estimates, na.rm = TRUE)}&quot;)) min 0 print(glue(&quot;max {max(estimates, na.rm = TRUE)}&quot;)) max 0.95 print(glue(&quot;sd {sd(estimates, na.rm = TRUE)}&quot;)) sd 0.303451107421411 A good use of aggregation is to check the quality of the data. For example, we can ask if there are any records where some of the estimate, the low value, or the high value are missing, but not all of them: print((infant_hiv.hi.isnull() != infant_hiv.lo.isnull()).any()) False any(is.na(infant_hiv$hi) != is.na(infant_hiv$lo)) [1] FALSE 5.7 How do I filter data? By “filtering”, we mean “selecting records by value”. As discussed in Chapter 2, the simplest approach is to use a vector of logical values to keep only the values corresponding to TRUE. In Python, this is: maximal = estimates[estimates &gt;= 0.95] print(len(maximal)) 52 And in R: maximal &lt;- estimates[estimates &gt;= 0.95] length(maximal) [1] 1052 The difference is unexpected. Let’s have a closer look at the result in Python: print(maximal) 180 0.95 181 0.95 182 0.95 183 0.95 184 0.95 185 0.95 187 0.95 360 0.95 361 0.95 362 0.95 379 0.95 380 0.95 381 0.95 382 0.95 384 0.95 385 0.95 386 0.95 446 0.95 447 0.95 461 0.95 ... And in R: maximal [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [14] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [27] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [40] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [53] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [66] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [79] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [92] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [105] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [118] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 [131] 0.95 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [144] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [157] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [170] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [183] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [196] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [209] 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 NA NA NA [222] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [235] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [248] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ... It appears that R has kept the unknown values in order to highlight just how little we know. More precisely, wherever there was an NA in the original data there is an NA in the logical vector and hence an NA in the final vector. Let us then turn to which to get a vector of indices at which a vector contains TRUE. This function does not return indices for FALSE or NA: which(estimates &gt;= 0.95) [1] 181 182 183 184 185 186 188 361 362 363 380 381 382 383 [15] 385 386 387 447 448 462 793 794 795 796 797 798 911 912 [29] 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 1098 1107 1128 1429 1430 [43] 1462 1554 1604 1607 1625 1626 1627 1629 1708 1710 And as a quick check: length(which(estimates &gt;= 0.95)) [1] 52 So now we can index our vector with the result of the which: maximal &lt;- estimates[which(estimates &gt;= 0.95)] maximal [1] 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 [15] 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 [29] 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 [43] 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 0.95 But should we do this? Those NAs are important information, and should not be discarded so blithely. What we should really be doing is using the tools the tidyverse provides rather than clever indexing tricks. These behave consistently across a wide scale of problems and encourage use of patterns that make it easier for others to understand our programs. 5.8 How do I write tidy code? The six basic data transformation operations in the tidyverse are: filter: choose observations (rows) by value(s) arrange: reorder rows select: choose variables (columns) by name mutate: derive new variables from existing ones group_by: define subsets of rows for further processing summarize: combine many values to create a single new value filter(tibble, ...criteria...) keeps rows that pass all of the specified criteria: filter(infant_hiv, lo &gt; 0.5) # A tibble: 183 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ARG 2016 0.67 0.77 0.61 2 ARG 2017 0.66 0.77 0.6 3 AZE 2014 0.74 0.95 0.53 4 AZE 2015 0.83 0.95 0.64 5 AZE 2016 0.75 0.95 0.56 6 AZE 2017 0.74 0.95 0.56 7 BLR 2009 0.95 0.95 0.95 8 BLR 2010 0.95 0.95 0.95 9 BLR 2011 0.95 0.95 0.91 10 BLR 2012 0.95 0.95 0.95 # … with 173 more rows Notice that the expression is lo &gt; 0.5 rather than \"lo\" &gt; 0.5. The latter expression would return the entire table because the string \"lo\" is greater than the number 0.5 everywhere. But how is it that the name lo can be used on its own? It is the name of a column, but there is no variable called lo. The answer is that R uses lazy evaluation: function arguments aren’t evaluated until they’re needed, so the function filter actually gets the expression lo &gt; 0.5, which allows it to check that there’s a column called lo and then use it appropriately. This is much tidier than filter(data, data$lo &gt; 0.5) or filter(data, \"lo &gt; 0.5\"). Many languages rely on lazy evaluation, and when used circumspectly, it allows us to produce code that is easier to read. We will explore it further in Chapter 8. We can make data anlaysis code more readable by using the pipe operator %&gt;%: infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) # A tibble: 183 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ARG 2016 0.67 0.77 0.61 2 ARG 2017 0.66 0.77 0.6 3 AZE 2014 0.74 0.95 0.53 4 AZE 2015 0.83 0.95 0.64 5 AZE 2016 0.75 0.95 0.56 6 AZE 2017 0.74 0.95 0.56 7 BLR 2009 0.95 0.95 0.95 8 BLR 2010 0.95 0.95 0.95 9 BLR 2011 0.95 0.95 0.91 10 BLR 2012 0.95 0.95 0.95 # … with 173 more rows This may not seem like much of an improvement, but neither does a Unix pipe consisting of cat filename.txt | head. What about this? filter(infant_hiv, (estimate != 0.95) &amp; (lo &gt; 0.5) &amp; (hi &lt;= (lo + 0.1))) # A tibble: 1 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 TTO 2017 0.94 0.95 0.86 It uses the vectorized “and” operator &amp; twice, and parsing the condition takes a human being at least a few seconds. Its pipelined equivalent is: infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(estimate != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% filter(hi &lt;= (lo + 0.1)) # A tibble: 1 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 TTO 2017 0.94 0.95 0.86 Breaking the condition into stages like this often makes reading and testing much easier, and encourages incremental write-test-extend development. Let’s increase the band from 10% to 20%: infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(estimate != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% filter(hi &lt;= (lo + 0.2)) # A tibble: 55 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ARG 2016 0.67 0.77 0.61 2 ARG 2017 0.66 0.77 0.6 3 CHL 2011 0.64 0.72 0.56 4 CHL 2013 0.67 0.77 0.59 5 CHL 2014 0.77 0.87 0.67 6 CHL 2015 0.92 0.95 0.79 7 CHL 2016 0.7 0.79 0.62 8 CHL 2017 0.85 0.95 0.76 9 CPV 2014 0.94 0.95 0.76 10 CPV 2016 0.94 0.95 0.76 # … with 45 more rows and then order by lo in descending order, breaking the line the way the tidyverse style guide recommends: infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(estimate != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% filter(hi &lt;= (lo + 0.2)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(lo)) # A tibble: 55 x 5 country year estimate hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 TTO 2017 0.94 0.95 0.86 2 SWZ 2011 0.93 0.95 0.84 3 CUB 2014 0.92 0.95 0.83 4 TTO 2016 0.9 0.95 0.83 5 CRI 2009 0.92 0.95 0.81 6 CRI 2012 0.89 0.95 0.81 7 NAM 2014 0.91 0.95 0.81 8 URY 2016 0.9 0.95 0.81 9 ZMB 2014 0.91 0.95 0.81 10 KAZ 2015 0.84 0.95 0.8 # … with 45 more rows We can now select the three columns we care about: infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(estimate != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% filter(hi &lt;= (lo + 0.2)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(lo)) %&gt;% select(year, lo, hi) # A tibble: 55 x 3 year lo hi &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2017 0.86 0.95 2 2011 0.84 0.95 3 2014 0.83 0.95 4 2016 0.83 0.95 5 2009 0.81 0.95 6 2012 0.81 0.95 7 2014 0.81 0.95 8 2016 0.81 0.95 9 2014 0.81 0.95 10 2015 0.8 0.95 # … with 45 more rows Once again, we are using the unquoted column names year, lo, and hi and letting R’s lazy evaluation take care of the details for us. Rather than selecting these three columns, we can select out the columns we’re not interested in by negating their names. This leaves the columns that are kept in their original order, rather than putting lo before hi, which won’t matter if we later select by name, but will if we ever want to select by position: infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(estimate != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% filter(hi &lt;= (lo + 0.2)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(lo)) %&gt;% select(-country, -estimate) # A tibble: 55 x 3 year hi lo &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2017 0.95 0.86 2 2011 0.95 0.84 3 2014 0.95 0.83 4 2016 0.95 0.83 5 2009 0.95 0.81 6 2012 0.95 0.81 7 2014 0.95 0.81 8 2016 0.95 0.81 9 2014 0.95 0.81 10 2015 0.95 0.8 # … with 45 more rows Giddy with power, we now add a column containing the difference between the low and high values. This can be done using either mutate, which adds new columns to the end of an existing tibble, or with transmute, which creates a new tibble containing only the columns we explicitly ask for. (There is also a function rename which simply renames columns.) Since we want to keep hi and lo, we decide to use mutate: infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(estimate != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% filter(hi &lt;= (lo + 0.2)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(lo)) %&gt;% select(-country, -estimate) %&gt;% mutate(difference = hi - lo) # A tibble: 55 x 4 year hi lo difference &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2017 0.95 0.86 0.0900 2 2011 0.95 0.84 0.110 3 2014 0.95 0.83 0.12 4 2016 0.95 0.83 0.12 5 2009 0.95 0.81 0.140 6 2012 0.95 0.81 0.140 7 2014 0.95 0.81 0.140 8 2016 0.95 0.81 0.140 9 2014 0.95 0.81 0.140 10 2015 0.95 0.8 0.150 # … with 45 more rows Does the difference between high and low estimates vary by year? To answer that question, we use group_by to group records by value and then summarize to aggregate within groups. We might as well get rid of the arrange and select calls in our pipeline at this point, since we’re not using them, and count how many records contributed to each aggregation using n(): infant_hiv %&gt;% filter(estimate != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(lo &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% filter(hi &lt;= (lo + 0.2)) %&gt;% mutate(difference = hi - lo) %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(count = n(), ave_diff = mean(year)) # A tibble: 9 x 3 year count ave_diff &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2009 3 2009 2 2010 3 2010 3 2011 5 2011 4 2012 5 2012 5 2013 6 2013 6 2014 10 2014 7 2015 6 2015 8 2016 10 2016 9 2017 7 2017 How might we do this with Pandas? One approach is to use a single multi-part .query to select data and store the result in a variable so that we can refer to the hi and lo columns twice without repeating the filtering expression. We then group by year and aggregate, again using strings for column names: data = pd.read_csv(&#39;tidy/infant_hiv.csv&#39;) data = data.query(&#39;(estimate != 0.95) &amp; (lo &gt; 0.5) &amp; (hi &lt;= (lo + 0.2))&#39;) data = data.assign(difference = (data.hi - data.lo)) grouped = data.groupby(&#39;year&#39;).agg({&#39;difference&#39; : {&#39;ave_diff&#39; : &#39;mean&#39;, &#39;count&#39; : &#39;count&#39;}}) /Users/gvwilson/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py:4658: FutureWarning: using a dict with renaming is deprecated and will be removed in a future version return super(DataFrameGroupBy, self).aggregate(arg, *args, **kwargs) print(grouped) difference ave_diff count year 2009 0.170000 3 2010 0.186667 3 2011 0.168000 5 2012 0.186000 5 2013 0.183333 6 2014 0.168000 10 2015 0.161667 6 2016 0.166000 10 2017 0.152857 7 There are other ways to tackle this problem with Pandas, but the tidyverse approach produces code that I find more readable. 5.9 How do I model my data? Tidying up data can be as calming and rewarding in the same way as knitting or rearranging the specimen jars on the shelves in your dining room-stroke-laboratory. Eventually, though, people want to do some statistics. The simplest tool for this in R is lm, which stands for “linear model”. Given a formula and a data set, it calculates coefficients to fit that formula to that data: lm(estimate ~ lo, data = infant_hiv) Call: lm(formula = estimate ~ lo, data = infant_hiv) Coefficients: (Intercept) lo 0.0421 1.0707 This is telling us that estimate is more-or-less equal to 0.0421 + 1.0707 * lo. The ~ symbol is used to separate the left and right sides of the equation, and as with all things tidyverse, lazy evaluation allows us to use variable names directly. In fact, it lets us write much more complex formulas involving functions of multiple variables. For example, we can regress estimate against the square roots of lo and hi, though there is no good statistical reason to do so: lm(estimate ~ sqrt(lo) + sqrt(hi), data = infant_hiv) Call: lm(formula = estimate ~ sqrt(lo) + sqrt(hi), data = infant_hiv) Coefficients: (Intercept) sqrt(lo) sqrt(hi) -0.2225 0.6177 0.4814 One important thing to note here is the way that + is overloaded in formulas. The formula estimate ~ lo + hi does not mean “regress estimate against the sum of lo and hi”, but rather, “regress estimate against the two variables lo and hi”: lm(estimate ~ lo + hi, data = infant_hiv) Call: lm(formula = estimate ~ lo + hi, data = infant_hiv) Coefficients: (Intercept) lo hi -0.01327 0.42979 0.56752 If we want to regress estiate against the average of lo and hi (i.e., regress estimate against a single calculated variable instead of against two variables) we need to create a temporary column: infant_hiv %&gt;% mutate(ave_lo_hi = (lo + hi)/2) %&gt;% lm(estimate ~ ave_lo_hi, data = .) Call: lm(formula = estimate ~ ave_lo_hi, data = .) Coefficients: (Intercept) ave_lo_hi -0.00897 1.01080 Here, the call to lm is using the variable . to mean “the data coming in from the previous stage of the pipeline”. Most of the functions in the tidyverse use this convention so that data can be passed to a function that expects it in a position other than the first. 5.10 How do I create a plot? One of R’s greatest strengths is the tools it gives us for seeing the hitherto unseeable. The most popular of these tools is ggplot2, which implements and extends the patterns described in Wilkinson (2005). Every chart it creates has a geometry that controls how data is displayed, and an mapping that controls how values are mapped to geometric properties. For example, these lines of code create a scatter plot showing the relationship between lo and hi values in the infant HIV data: ggplot(infant_hiv) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lo, y = hi)) Warning: Removed 1000 rows containing missing values (geom_point). Looking more closely: The function ggplot creates an object to represent the chart with infant_hiv as the underlying data. geom_point specifies the geometry we want (points). Its mapping argument is assigned an aesthetic that specifies lo is to be used as the x coordinate and hi is to be used as the y coordinate. The elements of the chart are combined with + rather than %&gt;% for historical reasons. Let’s create a slightly more appealing plot by dropping NAs, making the points semi-transparent, and colorizing them according to the value of estimate: infant_hiv %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lo, y = hi, color = estimate), alpha = 0.5) + xlim(0.0, 1.0) + ylim(0.0, 1.0) We set the transparency alpha outside the aesthetic because its value is constant for all points: if we set it inside aes(...), we would be telling ggplot2 to set the transparency according to the value of the data. We specify the limits to the axes manually with xlim and ylim to ensure that ggplot2 includes the upper bounds: we found by trial and error that without this, all of the data would be shown, but the upper label “1.00” would be omitted. This plot immediately shows us that we have some outliers. There are far more values with hi equal to 0.95 than it seems there ought to be, and there are eight points running up the left margin that seem troubling as well. Let’s create a new tibble that doesn’t have these: infant_hiv %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% filter(hi != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(!((lo &lt; 0.10) &amp; (hi &gt; 0.25))) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lo, y = hi, color = estimate), alpha = 0.5) + xlim(0.0, 1.0) + ylim(0.0, 1.0) We can add the fitted curve by including another geometry: infant_hiv %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% filter(hi != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(!((lo &lt; 0.10) &amp; (hi &gt; 0.25))) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lo, y = hi, color = estimate), alpha = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = lm, mapping = aes(x = lo, y = hi), color = &#39;red&#39;) + xlim(0.0, 1.0) + ylim(0.0, 1.0) Warning: Removed 8 rows containing missing values (geom_smooth). But wait: why is this complaining about missing values? Some online searches and guidance from the hill gods led to the discovery that geom_smooth adds virtual points to the data for plotting purposes, some of which lie outside the range of the actual data, and that setting xlim and ylim then truncates these. (Differently sane…) The safe way to control the range of the data is to add a call to coord_cartesian, which effectively zooms in on a region of interest: infant_hiv %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% filter(hi != 0.95) %&gt;% filter(!((lo &lt; 0.10) &amp; (hi &gt; 0.25))) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lo, y = hi, color = estimate), alpha = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = lm, mapping = aes(x = lo, y = hi), color = &#39;red&#39;) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.0, 1.0), ylim = c(0.0, 1.0)) 5.11 Key Points install.packages('name') installs packages. library(name) (without quoting the name) loads a package. library(tidyverse) loads the entire collection of tidyverse libraries at once. read_csv(filename) reads CSV files that use the string ‘NA’ to represent missing values. read_csv infers each column’s data types based on the first thousand values it reads. A tibble is the tidyverse’s version of a data frame, which represents tabular data. head(tibble) and tail(tibble) inspect the first and last few rows of a tibble. summary(tibble) displays a summary of a tibble’s structure and values. tibble$column selects a column from a tibble, returning a vector as a result. tibble['column'] selects a column from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result. tibble[,c] selects column c from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result. tibble[r,] selects row r from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result. Use ranges and logical vectors as indices to select multiple rows/columns or specific rows/columns from a tibble. tibble[[c]] selects column c from a tibble, returning a vector as a result. min(...), mean(...), max(...), and std(...) calculates the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of data. These aggregate functions include NAs in their calculations, and so will produce NA if the input data contains any. Use func(data, na.rm = TRUE) to remove NAs from data before calculations are done (but make sure this is statistically justified). filter(tibble, condition) selects rows from a tibble that pass a logical test on their values. arrange(tibble, column) or arrange(desc(column)) arrange rows according to values in a column (the latter in descending order). select(tibble, column, column, ...) selects columns from a tibble. select(tibble, -column) selects out a column from a tibble. mutate(tibble, name = expression, name = expression, ...) adds new columns to a tibble using values from existing columns. group_by(tibble, column, column, ...) groups rows that have the same values in the specified columns. summarize(tibble, name = expression, name = expression) aggregates tibble values (by groups if the rows have been grouped). tibble %&gt;% function(arguments) performs the same operation as function(tibble, arguments). Use %&gt;% to create pipelines in which the left side of each %&gt;% becomes the first argument of the next stage. References "],

Looking at the file, the second row has years (spaced at three-column intervals) and the column after that has the ISO3 country code, the country’s name, and then “Estimate”, “hi”, and “lo” repeated for every year. We are going to have to combine what’s in the second and third rows, so we’re going to have to do some work no matter which we skip or keep.

This happens because: our CSV file uses - (a single dash) to show missing data, and all of our numbers end with %, which means those values actually are character strings. We will tackle the first problem by setting na = c(\"-\") in our read_csv call (since we should never do ourselves what a library function will do for us): raw &lt;- read_csv(&quot;raw/infant_hiv.csv&quot;, skip = 2, na = c(&quot;-&quot;)) Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X30&#39; [30] Warning: Duplicated column names deduplicated: &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_1&#39; [6], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_1&#39; [7], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_1&#39; [8], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_2&#39; [9], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_2&#39; [10], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_2&#39; [11], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_3&#39; [12], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_3&#39; [13], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_3&#39; [14], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_4&#39; [15], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_4&#39; [16], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_4&#39; [17], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_5&#39; [18], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_5&#39; [19], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_5&#39; [20], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_6&#39; [21], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_6&#39; [22], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_6&#39; [23], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_7&#39; [24], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_7&#39; [25], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_7&#39; [26], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_8&#39; [27], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_8&#39; [28], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_8&#39; [29] Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_character() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications. head(raw) # A tibble: 6 x 30 ISO3 Countries Estimate hi lo Estimate_1 hi_1 lo_1 Estimate_2 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 AFG Afghanis… &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 2 ALB Albania &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 3 DZA Algeria &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 38% 4 AGO Angola &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 3% 4% 2% 5% 5 AIA Anguilla &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 6 ATG Antigua … &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; # … with 21 more variables: hi_2 &lt;chr&gt;, lo_2 &lt;chr&gt;, Estimate_3 &lt;chr&gt;, # hi_3 &lt;chr&gt;, lo_3 &lt;chr&gt;, Estimate_4 &lt;chr&gt;, hi_4 &lt;chr&gt;, lo_4 &lt;chr&gt;, # Estimate_5 &lt;chr&gt;, hi_5 &lt;chr&gt;, lo_5 &lt;chr&gt;, Estimate_6 &lt;chr&gt;, # hi_6 &lt;chr&gt;, lo_6 &lt;chr&gt;, Estimate_7 &lt;chr&gt;, hi_7 &lt;chr&gt;, lo_7 &lt;chr&gt;, # Estimate_8 &lt;chr&gt;, hi_8 &lt;chr&gt;, lo_8 &lt;chr&gt;, X30 &lt;chr&gt; That’s progress. We now need to strip the percentage signs and convert what’s left to numeric values. To simplify our lives, let’s get the ISO3 and Countries columns out of the way.

How are we to trim this? Since there is only one file, we can manually count the number of rows we are interested in (or rather, open the file with an editor or spreadsheet program, scroll down, and check the line number), and then slice there. This is a very bad idea if we’re planning to use this script on other files—we should instead look for the first blank line or the entry for Zimbabwe or something like that—but let’s revisit the problem once we have our data in place. num_rows &lt;- 192 raw &lt;- read_csv(&quot;raw/infant_hiv.csv&quot;, skip = 2, na = c(&quot;-&quot;)) Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X30&#39; [30] Warning: Duplicated column names deduplicated: &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_1&#39; [6], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_1&#39; [7], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_1&#39; [8], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_2&#39; [9], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_2&#39; [10], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_2&#39; [11], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_3&#39; [12], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_3&#39; [13], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_3&#39; [14], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_4&#39; [15], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_4&#39; [16], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_4&#39; [17], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_5&#39; [18], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_5&#39; [19], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_5&#39; [20], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_6&#39; [21], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_6&#39; [22], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_6&#39; [23], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_7&#39; [24], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_7&#39; [25], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_7&#39; [26], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_8&#39; [27], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_8&#39; [28], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_8&#39; [29] Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_character() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications. sliced &lt;- slice(raw, 1:num_rows) countries &lt;- sliced$ISO3 tail(countries, n = 5) [1] &quot;VEN&quot; &quot;VNM&quot; &quot;YEM&quot; &quot;ZMB&quot; &quot;ZWE&quot; Notice that we’re counting rows not including the two we’re skipping, which means that the 192 in the call to slice above corresponds to row 195 of our original data: 195, not 194, because we’re using the first row of unskipped data as headers and yes, you are in fact making that faint whimpering sound you now hear. You will hear it often when dealing with real-world data… And notice also that we are slicing, then extracting the column containing the countries.

It appears that some function that str_replace is calling is expecting an atomic vector, not a tibble. It worked for our test case because that was a character vector, but tibbles have more structure than that. The second complaint is that NAs were introduced, which is troubling because we didn’t get a complaint when we had actual NAs in our data. However, is.numeric tells us that all of our results are numbers. Let’s take a closer look: is_tibble(body) [1] TRUE is_tibble(numbers) [1] FALSE Perdition. After browsing the data, we realize that some entries are \"&gt;95%\", i.e., there is a greater-than sign as well as a percentage in the text. We will need to regularize those before we do any conversions. Before that, however, let’s see if we can get rid of the percent signs. The obvious way is is to use str_replace(body, \"%\", \"\"), but that doesn’t work: str_replace works on vectors, but a tibble is a list of vectors. Instead, we can use a higher-order function called map to apply the function str_replace to each column in turn to get rid of the percent signs: raw &lt;- read_csv(&quot;raw/infant_hiv.csv&quot;, skip = 2, na = c(&quot;-&quot;)) Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X30&#39; [30] Warning: Duplicated column names deduplicated: &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_1&#39; [6], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_1&#39; [7], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_1&#39; [8], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_2&#39; [9], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_2&#39; [10], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_2&#39; [11], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_3&#39; [12], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_3&#39; [13], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_3&#39; [14], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_4&#39; [15], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_4&#39; [16], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_4&#39; [17], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_5&#39; [18], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_5&#39; [19], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_5&#39; [20], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_6&#39; [21], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_6&#39; [22], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_6&#39; [23], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_7&#39; [24], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_7&#39; [25], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_7&#39; [26], &#39;Estimate&#39; =&gt; &#39;Estimate_8&#39; [27], &#39;hi&#39; =&gt; &#39;hi_8&#39; [28], &#39;lo&#39; =&gt; &#39;lo_8&#39; [29] Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_character() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications. sliced &lt;- slice(raw, 1:192) countries &lt;- sliced$ISO3 body &lt;- raw %&gt;% select(-ISO3, -Countries) trimmed &lt;- map(body, str_replace, pattern = &quot;%&quot;, replacement = &quot;&quot;) head(trimmed) $Estimate [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA [7] NA NA NA NA &quot;26&quot; NA [13] NA NA NA &quot;&gt;95&quot; NA &quot;77&quot; [19] NA NA &quot;7&quot; NA NA &quot;25&quot; [25] NA NA &quot;3&quot; NA &quot;&gt;95&quot; NA [31] &quot;27&quot; NA &quot;1&quot; NA NA NA [37] &quot;5&quot; NA &quot;8&quot; NA &quot;92&quot; NA [43] NA &quot;83&quot; NA NA NA NA [49] NA NA NA &quot;28&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;4&quot; [55] NA NA NA NA &quot;4&quot; NA [61] NA NA NA NA &quot;61&quot; NA [67] NA NA NA NA NA NA [73] NA NA &quot;61&quot; NA NA NA [79] NA &quot;2&quot; NA NA NA NA [85] NA NA NA &quot;&gt;95&quot; NA NA [91] NA NA NA NA NA &quot;43&quot; [97] &quot;5&quot; NA NA NA NA NA [103] &quot;37&quot; NA &quot;8&quot; NA NA NA [109] NA NA NA NA NA &quot;2&quot; [115] NA NA NA NA &quot;2&quot; NA [121] NA &quot;50&quot; NA &quot;4&quot; NA NA [127] NA &quot;1&quot; NA NA NA NA [133] NA NA &quot;1&quot; NA NA NA [139] &quot;&gt;95&quot; NA NA &quot;58&quot; NA NA [145] NA NA NA NA &quot;11&quot; NA [151] NA NA NA NA NA NA [157] NA NA NA NA NA NA [163] &quot;9&quot; NA NA NA NA &quot;1&quot; [169] NA NA NA &quot;7&quot; NA NA [175] NA NA NA NA &quot;8&quot; &quot;78&quot; [181] NA NA &quot;13&quot; NA NA &quot;0&quot; [187] NA NA NA NA &quot;59&quot; NA [193] &quot;&quot; &quot;2009&quot; &quot;Estimate&quot; &quot;25&quot; &quot;23&quot; NA [199] &quot;24&quot; &quot;2&quot; NA &quot;1&quot; &quot;8&quot; NA [205] &quot;7&quot; &quot;72&quot; &quot;16&quot; &quot;17&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; [211] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; $hi [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA &quot;35&quot; ...

Let’s backtrack by examining the hi column of each of our intermediate variables interactively in the console… …and there’s our bug. We are creating a variable called sliced that has only the rows we care about, but then using the full table in raw to create body. It’s a simple mistake, and one that could easily have slipped by us.

We now have numeric values in percents and corresponding ISO3 codes in countries. What we do not have is tidy data: countries are not associated with records, years are not recorded at all, and the column headers for percents have mostly been manufactured for us by R. We must now sew these parts together like Dr. Frankenstein’s trusty assistant Igor (who, like so many lab assistants, did most of the actual work but was given only crumbs of credit). We could write a loop to grab three columns at a time and relabel them, but a more concise solution makes use of two functions called gather and separate. gather takes multiple columns and collapses them into key-value pairs. To show how it works, let’s create a small tibble by hand using the function tribble. The first few arguments use ~ as a prefix operator to define columns names, and all of the other values are then put into a tibble with those columns: small &lt;- tribble( ~ISO, ~est, ~hi, ~lo, &#39;ABC&#39;, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2, &#39;DEF&#39;, 0.55, 0.6, 0.5 ) small # A tibble: 2 x 4 ISO est hi lo &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ABC 0.25 0.3 0.2 2 DEF 0.55 0.6 0.5 and then gather the three columns est, hi, and lo: small %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;kind&quot;, value = &quot;reported&quot;, est, hi, lo) # A tibble: 6 x 3 ISO kind reported &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ABC est 0.25 2 DEF est 0.55 3 ABC hi 0.3 4 DEF hi 0.6 5 ABC lo 0.2 6 DEF lo 0.5 The key and value parameters tell gather to create new columns with the specified names (in this case, kind and reported). The first of these columns (kind in our case) is filled by repeating the column headings from the original tibble; the second column (reported in our case) is then filled with the original tibble’s values. separate splits one column into two. For example, if we have the year and the heading type in a single column: single &lt;- tribble( ~combined, ~value, &#39;2009-est&#39;, 123, &#39;2009-hi&#39;, 456, &#39;2009-lo&#39;, 789, &#39;2010-est&#39;, 987, &#39;2010-hi&#39;, 654, &#39;2010-lo&#39;, 321 ) single # A tibble: 6 x 2 combined value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2009-est 123 2 2009-hi 456 3 2009-lo 789 4 2010-est 987 5 2010-hi 654 6 2010-lo 321 we can get the year and the heading into separate columns by separating on the - character: single %&gt;% separate(combined, sep = &quot;-&quot;, c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;kind&quot;)) # A tibble: 6 x 3 year kind value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2009 est 123 2 2009 hi 456 3 2009 lo 789 4 2010 est 987 5 2010 hi 654 6 2010 lo 321 Our strategy is therefore going to be: Replace the double column headers in the existing data with a single header that combines the year with the kind. Gather the data so that the year-kind values are in a single column. Split that column. We’ve seen the tools we need for the second and third step; the first involves a little bit of list manipulation. Let’s start by repeating \"est\", \"hi\", and \"lo\" as many times as we need them: num_years &lt;- 1 + 2017 - 2009 kinds &lt;- rep(c(&quot;est&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;), num_years) kinds [1] &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; [12] &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; [23] &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; &quot;est&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;lo&quot; As you can probably guess from its name, rep repeats things a specified number of times, and as noted previously, a vector of vectors is flattened into a single vector. What about the years? We want to wind up with: c(&quot;2009&quot;, &quot;2009&quot; &quot;2009&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, ...) i.e., with each year repeated three times. rep won’t do this, but we can get there with map: years &lt;- map(2009:2017, rep, 3) years [[1]] [1] 2009 2009 2009 [[2]] [1] 2010 2010 2010 [[3]] [1] 2011 2011 2011 [[4]] [1] 2012 2012 2012 [[5]] [1] 2013 2013 2013 [[6]] [1] 2014 2014 2014 [[7]] [1] 2015 2015 2015 [[8]] [1] 2016 2016 2016 [[9]] [1] 2017 2017 2017 That’s almost right, but map hasn’t flattened the list for us. Luckily, we can use unlist to do that: years &lt;- map(2009:2017, rep, 3) %&gt;% unlist() years [1] 2009 2009 2009 2010 2010 2010 2011 2011 2011 2012 2012 2012 2013 2013 [15] 2013 2014 2014 2014 2015 2015 2015 2016 2016 2016 2017 2017 2017 We can now combine the years and kinds by pasting the two vectors together with \"-\" as a separator: headers &lt;- paste(years, kinds, sep = &quot;-&quot;) headers [1] &quot;2009-est&quot; &quot;2009-hi&quot; &quot;2009-lo&quot; &quot;2010-est&quot; &quot;2010-hi&quot; &quot;2010-lo&quot; [7] &quot;2011-est&quot; &quot;2011-hi&quot; &quot;2011-lo&quot; &quot;2012-est&quot; &quot;2012-hi&quot; &quot;2012-lo&quot; [13] &quot;2013-est&quot; &quot;2013-hi&quot; &quot;2013-lo&quot; &quot;2014-est&quot; &quot;2014-hi&quot; &quot;2014-lo&quot; [19] &quot;2015-est&quot; &quot;2015-hi&quot; &quot;2015-lo&quot; &quot;2016-est&quot; &quot;2016-hi&quot; &quot;2016-lo&quot; [25] &quot;2017-est&quot; &quot;2017-hi&quot; &quot;2017-lo&quot; Let’s use this to relabel the columns of percents (which holds our data without the ISO country codes): names(percents) &lt;- headers Warning: The `names` must have length 28, not 27.

If people are going to use our cleaned-up data in their analyses, we need a better way to develop and check our scripts. 6.5 Key Points Develop data-cleaning scripts one step at a time, checking intermediate results carefully. Use read_csv to read CSV-formatted tabular data into a tibble. Use the skip and na parameters of read_csv to skip rows and interpret certain values as NA. Use str_replace to replace portions of strings that match patterns with new strings. Use is.numeric to test if a value is a number and as.numeric to convert it to a number. Use map to apply a function to every element of a vector in turn. Use map_dfc and map_dfr to map functions across the columns and rows of a tibble. Pre-allocate storage in a list for each result from a loop and fill it in rather than repeatedly extending the list. "],

How can I handle errors myself? How can I test R code? How can I test an R package? 7.2 Learning Objectives Name and describe the three levels of error handling in R. Handle an otherwise-fatal error in a function call in R. Create unit tests in R. Create unit tests for an R package. Novices write code and pray that it works. Experienced programmers know that prayer alone is not enough, and take steps to protect what little sanity they have left. This chapter looks at the tools R gives us for doing this. 7.3 How does R handle errors? Python programs handle errors by raising and catching exceptions: values = [-1, 0, 1] for i in range(4): try: reciprocal = 1/values[i] print(&quot;index {} value {} reciprocal {}&quot;.format(i, values[i], reciprocal)) except ZeroDivisionError: print(&quot;index {} value {} ZeroDivisionError&quot;.format(i, values[i])) except Exception as e: print(&quot;index{} some other Exception: {}&quot;.format(i, e)) index 0 value -1 reciprocal -1.0 index 1 value 0 ZeroDivisionError index 2 value 1 reciprocal 1.0 index3 some other Exception: list index out of range R draws on a different tradition. We say that the operation signals a condition that some other piece of code then handles. These things are all simpler to do using the rlang library, so we begin by loading that: In order of increasing severity, the three built-in kinds of conditions are messages, warnings, and errors. (There are also interrupts, which are generated by the user pressing Ctrl-C to stop an operation, but we will ignore those for the sake of brevity.) We can signal conditions of these kinds using the functions message, warning, and stop, each of which takes an error message as a parameter: message(&quot;This is a message.&quot;) This is a message. warning(&quot;This is a warning.\\n&quot;) Warning: This is a warning. stop(&quot;This is an error.&quot;) Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): This is an error. Note that we have to supply our own line ending for warnings but not for the other two cases. Note also that there are very few situations in which a warning is appropriate: if something has truly gone wrong then we should stop, but otherwise we should not distract users from more pressing concerns. The bluntest of instruments for handling errors is to ignore them. If a statement is wrapped in the function try then errors that occur in it are still reported, but execution continues. Compare this: attemptWithoutTry &lt;- function(left, right){ temp &lt;- left + right &quot;result&quot; # returned } result &lt;- attemptWithoutTry(1, &quot;two&quot;) Error in left + right: non-numeric argument to binary operator cat(&quot;result is&quot;, result) Error in cat(&quot;result is&quot;, result): object &#39;result&#39; not found with this: attemptUsingTry &lt;- function(left, right){ temp &lt;- try(left + right) &quot;value returned&quot; # returned } result &lt;- attemptUsingTry(1, &quot;two&quot;) Error in left + right : non-numeric argument to binary operator cat(&quot;result is&quot;, result) result is value returned We can suppress error messages from try by setting silent to TRUE: attemptUsingTryQuietly &lt;- function(left, right){ temp &lt;- try(left + right, silent = TRUE) &quot;result&quot; # returned } result &lt;- attemptUsingTryQuietly(1, &quot;two&quot;) cat(&quot;result is&quot;, result) result is result Do not do this, lest you one day find yourself lost in a silent hellscape. Should you more sensibly wish to handle conditions rather than ignore them, you may invoke tryCatch. We begin by raising an error explicitly: tryCatch( stop(&quot;our message&quot;), error = function(cnd) print(glue(&quot;error object is {cnd}&quot;)) ) error object is Error in doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler): our message We can now run a function that would otherwise blow up: tryCatch( attemptWithoutTry(1, &quot;two&quot;), error = function(cnd) print(glue(&quot;error object is {cnd}&quot;)) ) error object is Error in left + right: non-numeric argument to binary operator We can also handle non-fatal errors using withCallingHandlers, and define new types of conditions, but this is done less often in day-to-day R code than in Python: see Advanced R or this tutorial for details. 7.4 What should I know about testing in general? In keeping with common programming practice, we have left testing until the last possible moment. The standard testing library for R is testthat, which shares many features with Python’s unittest and other unit testing libraries: Each test consists of a single function that tests a single property or behavior of the system. Tests are collected into files with prescribed names that can be found by a test runner. Shared setup and teardown steps are put in functions of their own. Let’s load it and write our first test: library(testthat) Attaching package: &#39;testthat&#39; The following objects are masked from &#39;package:rlang&#39;: is_false, is_null, is_true The following object is masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: matches The following object is masked from &#39;package:purrr&#39;: is_null test_that(&quot;Zero equals itself&quot;, {expect_equal(0, 0)}) As is conventional with unit testing libraries, no news is good news: if a test passes, it doesn’t produce output because it doesn’t need our attention. Let’s try something that ought to fail: test_that(&quot;Zero equals one&quot;, {expect_equal(0, 1)}) Error: Test failed: &#39;Zero equals one&#39; * 0 not equal to 1. 1/1 mismatches [1] 0 - 1 == -1 Good: we can draw some comfort from the fact that Those Beyond have not yet changed the fundamental rules of arithmetic. But what are the curly braces around expect_equal for? The answer is that they create a code block for test_that to run. We can run expect_equal on its own: expect_equal(0, 1) Error: 0 not equal to 1. 1/1 mismatches [1] 0 - 1 == -1 but that doesn’t produce a summary of how many tests passed or failed. Passing a block of code to test_that also allows us to check several things in one test: test_that(&quot;Testing two things&quot;, { expect_equal(0, 0) expect_equal(0, 1) }) Error: Test failed: &#39;Testing two things&#39; * 0 not equal to 1. 1/1 mismatches [1] 0 - 1 == -1 A block of code is not the same thing as an anonymous function, which is why running this block of code does nothing—the “test” defines a function but doesn’t actually call it: test_that(&quot;Using an anonymous function&quot;, function() { print(&quot;In our anonymous function&quot;) expect_equal(0, 1) }) 7.5 How should I organize my tests? Running blocks of tests by hand is a bad practice. Instead, we should put related tests in files and then put those files in a directory called tests/testthat. We can then run some or all of those tests with a single command. To start, let’s create tests/testthat/test_example.R: library(testthat) context(&quot;Demonstrating the testing library&quot;) test_that(&quot;Testing a number with itself&quot;, { expect_equal(0, 0) expect_equal(-1, -1) expect_equal(Inf, Inf) }) test_that(&quot;Testing different numbers&quot;, { expect_equal(0, 1) }) test_that(&quot;Testing with a tolerance&quot;, { expect_equal(0, 0.01, tolerance = 0.05, scale = 1) expect_equal(0, 0.01, tolerance = 0.005, scale = 1) }) The first line loads the testthat package, which gives us our tools. The call to context on the second line gives this set of tests a name for reporting purposes. After that, we add as many calls to test_that as we want, each with a name and a block of code. We can now run this file from within RStudio: test_dir(&quot;tests/testthat&quot;) ✔ | OK F W S | Context ⠏ | 0 | Skipping rows correctly ⠸ | 0 4 | Skipping rows correctly ✖ | 0 5 | Skipping rows correctly [0.1 s] ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── test_determine_skip_rows_a.R:9: failure: The right row is found when there are header rows `result` not equal to 2.

There are four test_that calls, but eight actual checks, and the number of successes and failures is counted by recording the latter, not the former. What then is the purpose of test_that? Why not just use expect_equal and its kin, such as expect_true, expect_false, expect_length, and so on? The answer is that it allows us to do one operation and then check several things afterward.

To give ourselves something to test, let’s create a file called scripts/find_empty_01.R containing a single function find_empty_rows to identy all the empty rows in a CSV file. Our first implementation is: find_empty_rows &lt;- function(source) { data &lt;- read_csv(source) empty &lt;- data %&gt;% pmap(function(...) { args &lt;- list(...) all(is.na(args) | (args == &quot;&quot;)) }) data %&gt;% transmute(id = row_number()) %&gt;% filter(as.logical(empty)) %&gt;% pull(id) } This is complex enough to merit line-by-line exegesis: Define the function with one argument source, whence we shall read. Read tabular data from that source and assign the resulting tibble to data. Begin a pipeline that will assign something to the variable empty. Use pmap to map a function across each row of the tibble. Since we don’t know how many columns are in each row, we use ... to take any number of arguments. Convert the variable number of arguments to a list. Check to see if all of those arguments are either NA or the empty string. Close the mapped function’s definition. Start another pipeline. Its result isn’t assigned to a variable, so whatever it produces will be the value returned by find_empty_rows. Construct a tibble that contains only the row numbers of the original table in a column called id. Filter those row numbers to keep only those corresponding to rows that were entirely empty. The as.logical call inside filter is needed because the value returned by pmap (which we stored in empty) is a list, not a logical vector. Use pull to get the one column we want from the filtered tibble as a vector. There is a lot going on here, particularly if you are new to R (as I am at the time of writing) and needed help to figure out that pmap is the function this problem wants. But now that we have it, we can do this: source(&quot;scripts/find_empty_01.R&quot;) find_empty_rows(&quot;a,b\\n1,2\\n,\\n5,6&quot;) The source function reads R code from the given source. Using this inside an RMarkdown file is usually a bad idea, since the generated HTML or PDF won’t show readers what code we loaded and ran. On the other hand, if we are creating command-line tools for use on clusters or in other batch processing modes, and are careful to display the code in a nearby block, the stain on our soul is excusable. The more interesting part of this example is the call to find_empty_rows. Instead of giving it the name of a file, we have given it the text of the CSV we want parsed. This string is passed to read_csv, which (according to documentation that only took us 15 minutes to realize we had already seen) interprets its first argument as a filename or as the actual text to be parsed if it contains a newline character. This allows us to write put the test fixture right there in the code as a literal string, which experience shows is to understand and maintain than having test data in separate files. Our function seems to work, but we can make it more pipelinesque: find_empty_rows &lt;- function(source) { read_csv(source) %&gt;% pmap_lgl(function(...) { args &lt;- list(...) all(is.na(args) | (args == &quot;&quot;)) }) %&gt;% tibble(empty = .) %&gt;% mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;% filter(empty) %&gt;% pull(id) } Going line by line once again: Define a function with one argument called source, from which we shall once again read. Read from that source to fill the pipeline. Map our test for emptiness across each row, returning a logical vector as a result. (pmap_lgl is a derivative of pmap that always casts its result to logical. Similar functions like pmap_dbl return vectors of other types; and many other tidyverse functions also have strongly-typed variants.) Turn that logical vector into a single-column tibble, giving that column the name “empty”. We explain the use of . below. Add a second column with row numbers. Discard rows that aren’t empty. Return a vector of the remaining row IDs. Wat? Buried in the middle of the pipe shown above is the expression: tibble(empty = .) Quoting from Advanced R, “The function arguments look a little quirky but allow you to refer to . for one argument functions, .x and .y. for two argument functions, and ..1, ..2, ..3, etc, for functions with an arbitrary number of arguments.” In other words, . in tidyverse functions usually means “whatever is on the left side of the %&gt;% operator”, i.e., whatever would normally be passed as the function’s first argument. Without this, we have no easy way to give the sole column of our newly-constructed tibble a name. Here’s our first batch of tests: library(tidyverse) library(testthat) context(&quot;Finding empty rows&quot;) source(&quot;../../scripts/find_empty_02.R&quot;) test_that(&quot;A single non-empty row is not mistakenly detected&quot;, { result &lt;- find_empty_rows(&quot;a\\n1&quot;) expect_equal(result, NULL) }) test_that(&quot;Half-empty rows are not mistakenly detected&quot;, { result &lt;- find_empty_rows(&quot;a,b\\n,2&quot;) expect_equal(result, NULL) }) test_that(&quot;An empty row in the middle is found&quot;, { result &lt;- find_empty_rows(&quot;a,b\\n1,2\\n,\\n5,6&quot;) expect_equal(result, c(2L)) }) And here’s what happens when we run this file with test_dir: test_dir(&quot;tests/testthat&quot;, &quot;find_empty_a&quot;) ✔ | OK F W S | Context ⠏ | 0 | Finding empty rows ✖ | 1 2 | Finding empty rows ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── test_find_empty_a.R:9: failure: A single non-empty row is not mistakenly detected `result` not equal to NULL.

Types not compatible: integer is not NULL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ OK: 1 Failed: 2 Warnings: 0 Skipped: 0 This is perplexing: we expected that if there were no empty rows, our function would return NULL. Let’s look more closely: find_empty_rows(&quot;a\\n1&quot;) integer(0) Ah: our function is returning an integer vector of zero length rather than NULL. Let’s have a closer look at the properties of this strange beast: print(glue(&quot;integer(0) equal to NULL? {is.null(integer(0))}&quot;)) integer(0) equal to NULL? FALSE print(glue(&quot;any(logical(0))? {any(logical(0))}&quot;)) any(logical(0))? FALSE print(glue(&quot;all(logical(0))? {all(logical(0))}&quot;)) all(logical(0))? TRUE All right. If we compare c(1L, 2L) to NULL, we expect c(FALSE, FALSE), so it’s reasonable to get a zero-length logical vector as a result when we compare NULL to an integer vector with no elements. The fact that any of an empty logical vector is FALSE isn’t really surprising either—none of the elements are TRUE, so it would be hard to say that any of them are. all of an empty vector being TRUE is unexpected, though. The reasoning is apparently that none of the (nonexistent) elements are FALSE, but honestly, at this point we are veering dangerously close to JavaScript Logic, so we will accept this result for what it is and move on. So what should our function return when there aren’t any empty rows: NULL or integer(0)? After a bit of thought, we decide on the latter, which means it’s the tests that we need to rewrite, not the code: library(tidyverse) library(testthat) context(&quot;Finding empty rows&quot;) source(&quot;../../scripts/find_empty_02.R&quot;) test_that(&quot;A single non-empty row is not mistakenly detected&quot;, { result &lt;- find_empty_rows(&quot;a\\n1&quot;) expect_equal(result, integer(0)) }) test_that(&quot;Half-empty rows are not mistakenly detected&quot;, { result &lt;- find_empty_rows(&quot;a,b\\n,2&quot;) expect_equal(result, integer(0)) }) test_that(&quot;An empty row in the middle is found&quot;, { result &lt;- find_empty_rows(&quot;a,b\\n1,2\\n,\\n5,6&quot;) expect_equal(result, c(2L)) }) And here’s what happens when we run this file with test_dir: test_dir(&quot;tests/testthat&quot;, &quot;find_empty_b&quot;) ✔ | OK F W S | Context ⠏ | 0 | Finding empty rows ✔ | 3 | Finding empty rows ══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ OK: 3 Failed: 0 Warnings: 0 Skipped: 0 7.7 How can I check data transformation? People normally write unit tests for the code in packages, not to check the steps taken to clean up particular datasets, but the latter are just as useful as the former. To illustrate, we have been given several more CSV files to clean up. The first, at_health_facilities.csv, shows the percentage of births at health facilities by country, year, and mother’s age. It comes from the same UNICEF website as our previous data, but has a different set of problems. Here are its first few lines: ,,GLOBAL DATABASES,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,[data.unicef.org],,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Indicator:,Delivered in health facilities,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Unit:,Percentage,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,Mother&#39;s age,,,,,,,,,,, iso3,Country/areas,year,Total ,age 15-17,age 18-19,age less than 20,age more than 20,age 20-34,age 35-49,Source,Source year,,,, AFG,Afghanistan,2010, 33 , 25 , 29 , 28 , 31 , 31 , 31 ,MICS,2010,,,, ALB,Albania,2005, 98 , 100 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 92 ,MICS,2005,,,, ALB,Albania,2008, 98 , 94 , 98 , 97 , 98 , 98 , 99 ,DHS,2008,,,, ... and its last: ZWE,Zimbabwe,2005, 66 , 64 , 64 , 64 , 67 , 69 , 53 ,DHS,2005,,,, ZWE,Zimbabwe,2009, 58 , 49 , 59 , 55 , 59 , 60 , 52 ,MICS,2009,,,, ZWE,Zimbabwe,2010, 64 , 56 , 66 , 62 , 64 , 65 , 60 ,DHS,2010,,,, ZWE,Zimbabwe,2014, 80 , 82 , 82 , 82 , 79 , 80 , 77 ,MICS,2014,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Definition:,Percentage of births delivered in a health facility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,&quot;The indicator refers to women who had a live birth in a recent time period, generally two years for MICS and five years for DHS.&quot;,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Note:,&quot;Database include reanalyzed data from DHS and MICS, using a reference period of two years before the survey.&quot;,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,Includes surveys which microdata were available as of April 2016. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Source:,&quot;UNICEF global databases 2016 based on DHS, MICS .&quot;,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Contact us:,data@unicef.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,, There are two other files in this collection called c_sections.csv and skilled_attendant_at_birth.csv, which are the number of Caesarean sections and the number of births where a midwife or other trained practitioner was present. All three datasets have been exported from the same Excel spreadsheet; rather than writing a separate script for each, we should create a tool that will handle them all. At first glance, the problems we need to solve to do this are: Each file may have a different number of header rows (by inspection, two of the files have 7 and one has 8), so we should infer this number from the file. Each file may contain a different number of records, so our tool should select rows by content rather than by absolute row number. The files appear to have the same column names (for which we give thanks), but we should check this in case someone tries to use our function with a dataset that doesn’t. These three requirements will make our program significantly more complicated, so we should tackle each with its own testable function. 7.7.1 How can I reorganize code to make it more testable? The data we care about comes after the row with iso3, Country/areas, and other column headers, so the simplest way to figure out how many rows to skip is to read the data, look for this row, and discard everything above it. The simplest way to do that is to read the file once to find the number of header rows, then read it again, discarding that number of rows. It’s inefficient, but for a dataset this size, simplicity beats performance. Here’s our first try: read_csv(&quot;raw/at_health_facilities.csv&quot;) %&gt;% select(check = 1) %&gt;% mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;% filter(check == &quot;iso3&quot;) %&gt;% select(id) %&gt;% first() Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X1&#39; [1], &#39;X2&#39; [2], &#39;X4&#39; [4], &#39;X5&#39; [5], &#39;X6&#39; [6], &#39;X7&#39; [7], &#39;X8&#39; [8], &#39;X9&#39; [9], &#39;X10&#39; [10], &#39;X11&#39; [11], &#39;X12&#39; [12], &#39;X13&#39; [13], &#39;X14&#39; [14], &#39;X15&#39; [15], &#39;X16&#39; [16] Parsed with column specification: cols( X1 = col_character(), X2 = col_character(), `GLOBAL DATABASES` = col_character(), X4 = col_character(), X5 = col_character(), X6 = col_character(), X7 = col_character(), X8 = col_character(), X9 = col_character(), X10 = col_character(), X11 = col_character(), X12 = col_character(), X13 = col_character(), X14 = col_character(), X15 = col_character(), X16 = col_character() ) [1] 7 Ignoring the messages about missing column names, this tells us that iso3 appears in row 7 of our data, which is almost true: it’s actually in row 8, because read_csv has interpreted the first row of the raw CSV data as a header. On the bright side, that means we can immediately use this value as the skip parameter to the next read_csv call. How do we test this code? Easy: we turn it into a function, tell that function to stop if it can’t find iso3 in the data, and write some unit tests. The function is: library(tidyverse) determine_skip_rows &lt;- function(src_path) { read_csv(src_path) %&gt;% select(check = 1) %&gt;% mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;% filter(check == &quot;iso3&quot;) %&gt;% select(id) %&gt;% first() } We can then call usethis::use_testthat() to set up some testing infrastructure, including the directory tests/testthat and a script called tests/testthat.R that will run all our tests when we want to check the integrity of our project. Once we have done that we can put these five tests in tests/testthat/test_determine_skip_rows.R: library(tidyverse) library(testthat) context(&quot;Skipping rows correctly&quot;) source(&quot;../../scripts/determine_skip_rows_a.R&quot;) test_that(&quot;The right row is found when there are header rows&quot;, { result &lt;- determine_skip_rows(&quot;a1,a2\\nb1,b2\\nis03,stuff\\nc1,c2\\n&quot;) expect_equal(result, 2) }) test_that(&quot;The right row is found when there are header rows and blank lines&quot;, { result &lt;- determine_skip_rows(&quot;a1,a2\\nb1,b2\\n,\\nis03,stuff\\nc1,c2\\n,\\n&quot;) expect_equal(result, 3) }) test_that(&quot;The right row is found when there are no header rows to discard&quot;, { result &lt;- determine_skip_rows(&quot;iso3,stuff\\nc1,c2\\n&quot;) expect_equal(result, 0) }) test_that(&quot;No row is found when &#39;iso3&#39; isn&#39;t present&quot;, { expect_error(determine_skip_rows(&quot;a1,a2\\nb1,b1\\n&quot;), &quot;No start row found&quot;) }) test_that(&quot;No row is found when &#39;iso3&#39; is in the wrong place&quot;, { expect_error(determine_skip_rows(&quot;stuff,iso3\\n&quot;), &quot;No start row found&quot;) }) and run it: test_dir(&quot;tests/testthat&quot;, &quot;determine_skip_rows_a&quot;) ✔ | OK F W S | Context ⠏ | 0 | Skipping rows correctly ✖ | 0 5 | Skipping rows correctly ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── test_determine_skip_rows_a.R:9: failure: The right row is found when there are header rows `result` not equal to 2.

The first problem is that we have written is03 (with a digit 0 instead of a letter o) in the first two tests. If we fix that and re-run the tests, they pass; what about the other three? When there are no rows to skip, our function is returning integer(0) instead of 0 because the row with iso3 is being used as headers. When iso3 isn’t found at all, the function is returning integer(0) rather than stopping. Here is a more robust version of the function: library(tidyverse) determine_skip_rows &lt;- function(src_path) { data &lt;- read_csv(src_path) if (names(data)[1] == &quot;iso3&quot;) { return(0) } result &lt;- data %&gt;% select(check = 1) %&gt;% mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;% filter(check == &quot;iso3&quot;) %&gt;% select(id) %&gt;% first() if (length(result) == 0) { stop(&quot;No start row found in&quot;, src_path) } result } And here are the results: test_dir(&quot;tests/testthat&quot;, &quot;determine_skip_rows_b&quot;) ✔ | OK F W S | Context ⠏ | 0 | Skipping rows correctly ✔ | 5 | Skipping rows correctly ══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ OK: 5 Failed: 0 Warnings: 0 Skipped: 0 Our tests still aren’t checking anything statistical, but without trustworthy data, our statistics will be meaningless. Tests like these allow our future selves to focus on making new mistakes instead of repeating old ones. 7.8 Key Points Operations signal conditions in R when errors occur. The three built-in levels of conditions are messages, warnings, and errors. Programs can signal these themselves using the functions message, warning, and stop. Operations can be placed in a call to the function try to suppress errors, but this is a bad idea. Operations can be placed in a call to the function tryCatch to handle errors. Use testthat to write unit tests for R. Put unit tests for an R package in the tests/testthat directory. Put tests in files called test_group.R and call them test_something. Use test_dir to run tests from a particular that match a pattern. Write tests for data transformation steps as well as library functions. "],

How can we take advantage of this? 8.2 Learning Objectives Trace the order of evaluation in function calls. Explain what environments and expressions are and how they relate to one another. Justify the author’s use of ASCII art in the second decade of the 21st Century. The biggest difference between R and Python is not where R starts counting, but its use of lazy evaluation. Nothing truly makes sense in R until we understand how this works. 8.3 How does Python evaluate function calls? Let’s start by looking at a small Python program and its output: def ones_func(ones_arg): return ones_arg + &quot; ones&quot; def tens_func(tens_arg): return ones_func(tens_arg + &quot; tens&quot;) initial = &quot;start&quot; final = tens_func(initial + &quot; more&quot;) print(final) start more tens ones When we call tens_func we pass it initial + \" more\"; since initial has just been assigned \"start\", that’s the same as calling tens_func with \"start more\". tens_func then calls ones_func with \"start more tens\", and ones_func returns \"start more tens ones\". But there’s a lot more going on here than first meets the eye. Let’s spell out the steps: def ones_func(ones_arg): ones_temp_1 = ones_arg + &quot; ones&quot; return ones_temp_1 def tens_func(tens_arg): tens_temp_1 = tens_arg + &quot; tens&quot; tens_temp_2 = ones_func(tens_temp_1) return tens_temp_2 initial = &quot;start&quot; global_temp_1 = initial + &quot; more&quot; final = tens_func(global_temp_1) print(final) start more tens ones Step 1: we assign \"start\" to initial at the global level: Figure 8.1: Python Step 1 Step 2: we ask Python to call tens_func(initial + \"more\"), so it creates a temporary variable to hold the result of the concatenation before calling tens_func: Figure 8.2: Python Step 2 Step 3: Python creates a new stack frame to hold the call to tens_func: Figure 8.3: Python Step 3 Note that tens_arg points to the same thing in memory as global_temp_1, since Python passes everything by reference. Step 4: we ask Python to call ones_func(tens_arg + \" tens\"), so it creates another temporary: Figure 8.4: Python Step 4 Step 5: Python creates a new stack frame to hold the call to ones_func: Figure 8.5: Python Step 5 Step 6: Python creates a temporary to hold ones_arg + \"ones\": Figure 8.6: Python Step 6 Step 7: Python returns from ones_func and puts its result in yet another temporary variable in tens_func: Figure 8.7: Python Step 7 Step 8: Python returns from tens_func and puts its result in final: Figure 8.8: Python Step 8 The most important thing here is that Python evaluates expressions before it calls functions, and passes the results of those evaluations to the functions. This is called eager evaluation, and is what most widely-used programming languages do. 8.4 How does R evaluate the same kind of thing? In contrast, R uses lazy evaluation. Here’s an R program that’s roughly equivalent to the Python shown above: ones_func &lt;- function(ones_arg) { paste(ones_arg, &quot;ones&quot;) } tens_func &lt;- function(tens_arg) { ones_func(paste(tens_arg, &quot;tens&quot;)) } initial &lt;- &quot;start&quot; final &lt;- tens_func(paste(initial, &quot;more&quot;)) print(final) [1] &quot;start more tens ones&quot; And here it is with the intermediate steps spelled out in a syntax I just made up: ones_func &lt;- function(ones_arg) { ones_arg.RESOLVE(@tens_func@, paste(tens_arg, &quot;tens&quot;), &quot;start more tens&quot;) ones_temp_1 &lt;- paste(ones_arg, &quot;ones&quot;) return(ones_temp_1) } tens_func &lt;- function(tens_arg) { tens_arg.RESOLVE(@global@, paste(initial, &quot;more&quot;), &quot;start more&quot;) tens_temp_1 &lt;- PROMISE(@tens_func@, paste(tens_arg, &quot;tens&quot;), ____) tens_temp_2 &lt;- ones_func(paste(tens_temp_1)) return(tens_temp_2) } initial &lt;- &quot;start&quot; global_temp_1 &lt;- PROMISE(@global@, paste(initial, &quot;more&quot;), ____) final &lt;- tens_func(global_temp_1) print(final) While the original code looked much like our Python, the evaluation trace is very different, and hinges on the fact that an expression in a programming language can be represented as a data structure. What’s an Expression? An expression is anything that has a value. The simplest expressions are literal values like the number 1, the string \"stuff\", and the Boolean TRUE. A variable like least is also an expression: its value is whatever the variable currently refers to. Complex expressions are built out of simpler expressions: 1 + 2 is an expression that uses + to combine 1 and 2, while the expression c(10, 20, 30) uses the function c to create a vector out of the values 10, 20, 30. Expressions are often drawn as trees like this: + / \\ 1 2 When Python (or R, or any other language) reads a program, it parses the text and builds trees like the one shown above to represent what the program is supposed to do. Processing that data structure to find its value is called evaluating the expression. Most modern languages allow us to build trees ourselves, either by concatenating strings to create program text and then asking the language to parse the result: left &lt;- &#39;1&#39; right &lt;- &#39;2&#39; op &lt;- &#39;+&#39; combined &lt;- paste(left, op, right) tree &lt;- parse(text = combined) or by calling functions. The function-based approach is safer and more flexible; see Wickham (2019) for details. Step 1: we assign “start” to initial in the global environment: Figure 8.9: R Step 1 Step 2: we ask R to call tens_func(initial + \"more\"), so it creates a promise to hold: the environment we’re in (which I’m surrounding with @), the expression we’re passing to the function, and the value of that expression (which I’m showing as ____, since it’s initially empty). Figure 8.10: R Step 2 and in Step 3, passes that into tens_func: Figure 8.11: R Step 3 Crucially, the promise in tens_func remembers that it was created in the global environment: it’s eventually going to need a value for initial, so it needs to know where to look to find the right one. Step 4: since the very next thing we ask for is paste(tens_arg, \"tens\"), R needs a value for tens_arg. To get it, R evaluates the promise that tens_arg refers to: (#fig:r-step-4 )R Step 4 This evaluation happens after tens_func has been called, not before as in Python, which is why this scheme is called “lazy” evaluation. Once a promise has been resolved, R uses its value, and that value never changes. Steps 5: tens_func wants to call ones_func, so R creates another promise to record what’s being passed into ones_func: Figure 8.12: R Step 5 Step 6: R calls ones_func, binding the newly-created promise to ones_arg as it does so: Figure 8.13: R Step 6 Step 7: R needs a value for ones_arg to pass to paste, so it resolves the promise: Figure 8.14: R Step 7 Step 8: ones_func uses paste to concatenate strings: Figure 8.15: R Step 8 Step 9: ones_func returns: Figure 8.16: R Step 9 Step 10: tens_func returns: Figure 8.17: R Step 10 We got the same answer, but in a significantly different way. Each time we passed something into a function, R created a promise to record what it was and where it came from, and then resolved the promise when the value was needed. R always does this: if we call: sign(2) then behind the scenes, R is creating a promise and passing it to sign, where it is automatically resolved to get the number 2 when its value is needed. (If I wanted to be thorough, I would have shown the promises passed into paste at each stage of execution above, but that’s a lot of typing.) 8.5 Why is lazy evaluation useful? R’s lazy evaluation seems pointless if it always produces the same answer as Python’s eager evaluation, but as you may already have guessed, it doesn’t have to. To see how powerful lazy evaluation can be, let’s create an expression of our own: my_expr &lt;- expr(red) Displaying the value of my_expr isn’t very exciting: my_expr red but what kind of thing is it? typeof(my_expr) [1] &quot;symbol&quot; A symbol is a kind of expression. It is not a string (though strings can be converted to symbols and symbols to strings) nor is it a value—not yet. If we try to get the value it refers to, R displays an error message: eval(my_expr) Error in eval(my_expr): object &#39;red&#39; not found We haven’t created a variable called red, so R cannot evaluate an expression that asks for it. But what if we create such a variable now and then re-evaluate the expression? red &lt;- &quot;this is red&quot; eval(my_expr) [1] &quot;this is red&quot; More usefully, what if we create something that has a value for red: color_data &lt;- tribble( ~red, ~green, 1, 10, 20, 2 ) color_data # A tibble: 2 x 2 red green &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 10 2 20 2 and then ask R to evaluate our expression in the context of that tibble: eval(my_expr, color_data) [1] 1 20 When we do this, eval looks for definitions of variables in the data structure we’ve given it—in this case, in the tibble color_data. Since that tibble has a column called red, eval(my_expr, color_data) gives us that column. This may not seem life-changing yet, but being able to pass expressions around and evaluate them in contexts of our choosing allows us to seem very clever indeed. For example, let’s create another expression: add_red_green &lt;- expr(red + green) typeof(add_red_green) [1] &quot;language&quot; The type of add_red_green is language rather than symbol because it contains more than just a symbol, but it’s still an expression, so we can evaluate it in the context of our data frame: eval(add_red_green, color_data) [1] 11 22 Still not convinced? Have a look at this function: run_many_checks &lt;- function(data, ...) { conditions &lt;- list(...) checks &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, length(conditions)) for (i in seq_along(conditions)) { checks[[i]] &lt;- eval(conditions[[i]], data) } checks } It takes a tibble and some logical expressions, evaluates each expression in turn, and returns a vector of results: run_many_checks(color_data, expr(0 &lt; red), expr(red &lt; green)) [[1]] [1] TRUE TRUE [[2]] [1] TRUE FALSE We can take it one step further and simply report whether the checks passed or not: run_all_checks &lt;- function(data, ...) { conditions &lt;- list(...) checks &lt;- vector(&quot;logical&quot;, length(conditions)) for (i in seq_along(conditions)) { checks[[i]] &lt;- all(eval(conditions[[i]], data)) } all(checks) } run_all_checks(color_data, expr(0 &lt; red), expr(red &lt; green)) [1] FALSE This is cool, but typing expr(...) over and over is kind of clumsy. It also seems superfluous, since we know that arguments aren’t evaluated before they’re passed into functions. Can we get rid of this and write something that does this? check_all(color_data, 0 &lt; red, red &lt; green) The answer is going to be “yes”, but it’s going to take a bit of work. Square Brackets… Why’d It Have to Be Square Brackets? Before we go there, a word (or code snippet) of warning. The first version of run_many_checks essentially did this: conditions &lt;- list(expr(red &lt; green)) eval(conditions[1], color_data) What I did wrong was use [ instead of [[, which meant that conditions[1] was not an expression—it wa a list containing a single expression. It turns out that evaluating a list containing an expression produces a list of expressions rather than an error, which is so helpful that it only took me an hour to figure out my mistake. 8.6 What is tidy evaluation? Our goal is to write something that looks like it belongs in the tidyverse. We want to be able to write this: check_all(color_data, 0 &lt; red, red &lt; green) without calling expr to quote our expressions explicitly. For simplicity’s sake, our first attempt only handles a single expression: check_naive &lt;- function(data, test) { eval(test, data) } When we try it, it fails: check_naive(color_data, red != green) Error in eval(test, data): object &#39;green&#39; not found This makes sense: by the time we get to the eval call, test refers to a promise that represents the value of red != green in the global environment. Promises are not expressions—each promise contains an expression, but it also contains an environment and a copy of the expression’s value (if it has ever been calculated). As a result, when R sees the call to eval inside check_naive it automatically tries to resolve the promise that contains left != right, and fails because there are no variables with those names in the global environment. So how can we get the expression out of the promise without triggering evaluation? One way is to use a function called substitute: check_using_substitute &lt;- function(data, test) { subst_test &lt;- substitute(test) eval(subst_test, data) } check_using_substitute(color_data, red != green) [1] TRUE TRUE However, substitute is frowned upon because it does one thing when called interactively on the command line and something else when called inside a function. Instead, we should use a function called enquo from the rlang package. enquo returns an object called a quosure that contains only an unevaluated expression and an environment. Let’s try using that: check_using_enquo &lt;- function(data, test) { q_test &lt;- enquo(test) eval(q_test, data) } check_using_enquo(color_data, red != green) &lt;quosure&gt; expr: ^red != green env: global Ah: a quosure is a structured object, so evaluating it just gives it back to us in the same way that evaluating 2 or \"hello\" would. What we want to eval is the expression inside the quosure, which we can get using quo_get_expr: check_using_quo_get_expr &lt;- function(data, test) { q_test &lt;- enquo(test) eval(quo_get_expr(q_test), data) } check_using_quo_get_expr(list(left = 1, right = 2), left != right) [1] TRUE All right: we’re ready to write check_all. As a reminder, our test data looks like this: color_data # A tibble: 2 x 2 red green &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 10 2 20 2 Our first attempt (which only handles a single test) is going to fail on purpose to demonstrate a common mistake: check_without_quoting_test &lt;- function(data, test) { data %&gt;% transmute(result = test) %&gt;% pull(result) %&gt;% all() } check_without_quoting_test(color_data, red &lt; green) Error in mutate_impl(.data, dots): object &#39;green&#39; not found That failed because we’re not enquoting the test. Let’s modify it the code to enquote and then pass in the expression: check_without_quoting_test &lt;- function(data, test) { q_test &lt;- enquo(test) x_test &lt;- quo_get_expr(q_test) data %&gt;% transmute(result = x_test) %&gt;% pull(result) %&gt;% all() } check_without_quoting_test(color_data, red &lt; green) Error in mutate_impl(.data, dots): Column `result` is of unsupported type quoted call Damn—we thought this one had a chance. The problem is that when we say result = x_test, what actually gets passed into transmute is a promise containing an expression. Somehow, we need to prevent R from doing that promise wrapping. This brings us to enquo’s partner !!, which we can use to splice the expression in a quosure into a function call. !! is pronounced “bang bang” or “oh hell”, depending on how your day is going. It only works in contexts like function calls where R is automatically quoting things for us, but if we use it then, it does exactly what we want: check_using_bangbang &lt;- function(data, test) { q_test &lt;- enquo(test) data %&gt;% transmute(result = !!q_test) %&gt;% pull(result) %&gt;% all() } check_using_bangbang(color_data, red &lt; green) [1] FALSE We are almost in a state of grace. The two rules we must follow are: Use enquo to enquote every argument that contains an unevaluated expression. Use !! when passing each of those arguments into a tidyverse function. check_all &lt;- function(data, ...) { tests &lt;- enquos(...) result &lt;- TRUE for (t in tests) { result &lt;- result &amp;&amp; (data %&gt;% transmute(result = !!t) %&gt;% pull(result) %&gt;% all()) } result } check_all(color_data, 0 &lt; red, red &lt; green) [1] FALSE And just to make sure that it succeeds when it’s supposed to: check_all(color_data, red != green) [1] TRUE Backing up a bit, !! works because there are two broad categories of functions in R: evaluating functions and quoting functions. Evaluating functions take arguments as values—they’re what most of us are used to working with. Quoting functions, on the other hand, aren’t passed the values of expressions, but the expressions themselves. When we write color_data$red, the $ function is being passed color_data and the quoted expression red. This is why we can’t use variables as field names with $: the_string_red &lt;- &quot;red&quot; color_data$the_string_red Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: &#39;the_string_red&#39;. NULL The square bracket operators [ and [[, on the other hand, are evaluating functions, so we can give them a variable containing a column name and get either a single-column tibble: color_data[the_string_red] # single square brackets # A tibble: 2 x 1 red &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 2 20 or a naked vector: color_data[[the_string_red]] # double square brackets [1] 1 20 8.7 Is it worth it? Delayed evaluation and quoting are confusing for two reasons: They expose machinery that most programmers have never had to deal with before (and might not even have known existed). It’s rather like learning to drive an automatic transmission and then switching to a manual one—all of a sudden you have to worry about a gear shift and a clutch. R’s built-in tools don’t behave as consistently as they could, and the functions provided by the tidverse as alternatives use variations on a small number of names: quo, quote, and enquo might all appear on the same page. If you would like to know more, or check that what you now think you understand is accurate, this tutorial is a good next step. 8.8 Key Points R uses lazy evaluation: expressions are evaluated when their values are needed, not before. Use expr to create an expression without evaluating it. Use eval to evaluate an expression in the context of some data. Use enquo to create a quosure containing an unevaluated expression and its environment. Use quo_get_expr to get the expression out of a quosure. Use !! to splice the expression in a quosure into a function call. References "],

How do I specify an object’s class? How do I provide methods for a class? How should I create objects of a class I have defined? 9.2 Learning Objectives Correctly identify the most commonly used object-oriented programming system in R. Explain what attributes R and correctly set and query objects’ attributes, class, and dimensions. Explain how to define a new method for a class. Describe and implement the three functions that should be written for any user-defined class. Programmers spend a great deal of their time trying to create order out of chaos, and the rest of their time inventing new ways to create more chaos. Object-oriented programming serves both needs well: it allows good software designers to create marvels, and less conscientious or less experienced ones to manufacture horrors. R has not one, not two, but at least three different frameworks for object-oriented programming. By far the most widely used is S3 (because it was first introduced with Version 3 of S, the language from which R is derived). Unlike the approaches used in Python and similarly pedestrian languages, S3 does not require users to define classes. Instead, they add attributes to data, then write specialized versions of generic functions to process data identified by those attributes. Since attributes can be used in other ways as well, we will start by exploring them. 9.3 What are attributes? Let’s begin by creating a matrix containing the first few hundreds: values &lt;- 100 * 1:9 # creates c(100, 200, ..., 900) m &lt;- matrix(values, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) m [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 100 400 700 [2,] 200 500 800 [3,] 300 600 900 Behind the scenes, R continues to store our nine values as a vector. However, it adds an attribute called class to the vector to identify it as a matrix: class(m) [1] &quot;matrix&quot; and another attribute called dim to store its dimensions as a 2-element vector: dim(m) [1] 3 3 An object’s attributes are simply a set of name-value pairs. We can find out what attributes are present using attributes and show or set individual attributes using attr: attr(m, &quot;prospects&quot;) &lt;- &quot;dismal&quot; attributes(m) $dim [1] 3 3 $prospects [1] &quot;dismal&quot; What are the type and attributes of a tibble? t &lt;- tribble( ~a, ~b, 1, 2, 3, 4) typeof(t) [1] &quot;list&quot; attributes(t) $names [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; $row.names [1] 1 2 $class [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; This tells us that a tibble is stored as a list (the first line of output), and that it has an attribute called names that stores the names of its columns, another called row.names that stores the names of its rows (a feature we should ignore), and three classes. These classes tell R what functions to search for when we are (for example) asking for the length of a tibble (which is the number of rows it contains): length(t) [1] 2 9.4 How are classes represented? To show how classes and generic functions work together, let’s customize the way that 2D coordinates are converted to strings. First, we create two coordinate vectors: first &lt;- c(0.5, 0.7) class(first) &lt;- &quot;two_d&quot; print(first) [1] 0.5 0.7 attr(,&quot;class&quot;) [1] &quot;two_d&quot; second &lt;- c(1.3, 3.1) class(second) &lt;- &quot;two_d&quot; print(second) [1] 1.3 3.1 attr(,&quot;class&quot;) [1] &quot;two_d&quot; Separately, we define the behavior of toString for such objects: toString.two_d &lt;- function(obj){ paste0(&quot;&lt;&quot;, obj[1], &quot;, &quot;, obj[2], &quot;&gt;&quot;) } toString(first) [1] &quot;&lt;0.5, 0.7&gt;&quot; toString(second) [1] &quot;&lt;1.3, 3.1&gt;&quot; S3’s protocol is simple: given a function F and an object of class C, S3 looks for a function named F.C. If it doesn’t find one, it looks at the object’s next class (assuming it has more than one); once its user-assigned classes are exhausted, it uses whatever function the system has defined for its base type (in this case, character vector). We can trace this process by importing the sloop package and calling s3_dispatch: library(sloop) s3_dispatch(toString(first)) =&gt; toString.two_d * toString.default Compare this with calling toString on a plain old character vector: s3_dispatch(toString(c(7.1, 7.2))) toString.double toString.numeric =&gt; toString.default The specialized functions associated with a generic function like toString are called methods. Unlike languages that require methods to be defined all together as part of a class, S3 allows us to add methods when and as we see fit. But that doesn’t mean we should: minds confined to three dimensions of space and one of time are simply not capable of comprehending complex class hierarchies. Instead, we should always write three functions that work together for a class like two_d: A constructor called new_two_d that creates objects of our class. An optional validator called validate_two_d that checks the consistency and correctness of an object’s values. An optional helper, simply called two_d, that most users will call to create and validate objects. The constructor’s first argument should always be the base object (in our case, the two-element vector). It should also have one argument for each attribute the object is to have, if any. Unlike matrices, our 2D points don’t have any extra arguments, so our constructor needs no extra arguments. Crucially, the constructor checks the type of its arguments to ensure that the object has at least some chance of being valid. new_two_d &lt;- function(coordinates){ stopifnot(is.numeric(coordinates)) class(coordinates) &lt;- &quot;two_d&quot; coordinates } example &lt;- new_two_d(c(4.4, -2.2)) toString(example) [1] &quot;&lt;4.4, -2.2&gt;&quot; Validators are only needed when checks on data correctness and consistency are expensive. For example, if we were to define a class to represent sorted vectors, checking that each element is no less than its predecessor could take a long time for very long vectors. To illustrate this, we will check that we have exactly two coordinates; in real code, we would probably include this (inexpensive) check in the constructor. validate_two_d &lt;- function(coordinates) { stopifnot(length(coordinates) == 2) stopifnot(class(coordinates) == &quot;two_d&quot;) } validate_two_d(example) # should succeed silently validate_two_d(c(1, 3)) # should fail Error in validate_two_d(c(1, 3)): class(coordinates) == &quot;two_d&quot; is not TRUE validate_two_d(c(2, 2, 2)) # should also fail Error in validate_two_d(c(2, 2, 2)): length(coordinates) == 2 is not TRUE The third and final function in our trio provides a user-friendly way to construct objects of our new class. It should call the constructor and the validator (if one exists), but should also provide a richer set of defaults, better error messages, and so on. To illustrate this, we shall allow the user to provide either one argument (which must be a two-element vector) or two (which must each be numeric): two_d &lt;- function(...){ args &lt;- list(...) if (length(args) == 1) { args &lt;- args[[1]] # extract original value } else if (length(args) == 2) { args &lt;- unlist(args) # convert list to vector } result &lt;- new_two_d(args) validate_two_d(result) result } here &lt;- two_d(10.1, 11.2) toString(here) [1] &quot;&lt;10.1, 11.2&gt;&quot; there &lt;- two_d(c(15.6, 16.7)) toString(there) [1] &quot;&lt;15.6, 16.7&gt;&quot; 9.5 How does inheritance work? We said above that an object can have more than one class, and that S3 searches the classes in order when it wants to find a method to call. Methods can also trigger invocation of other methods explicitly in order to supplement, rather than replace, the behavior of other classes. To show how this works, we shall look at that classic of object-oriented design: shapes. (The safe kind, of course, not those whose non-Euclidean angles have placed such intolerable stress on the minds of so many of our colleagues over the years.) We start by defining a polygon class: new_polygon &lt;- function(coords, name) { points &lt;- map(coords, two_d) class(points) &lt;- &quot;polygon&quot; attr(points, &quot;name&quot;) &lt;- name points } toString.polygon &lt;- function(poly) { paste0(attr(poly, &quot;name&quot;), &quot;: &quot;, paste0(map(poly, toString), collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) } right &lt;- new_polygon(list(c(0, 0), c(1, 0), c(0, 1)), &quot;triangle&quot;) toString(right) [1] &quot;triangle: &lt;0, 0&gt;, &lt;1, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 1&gt;&quot; Now we will add colored shapes: new_colored_polygon &lt;- function(coords, name, color) { object &lt;- new_polygon(coords, name) attr(object, &quot;color&quot;) &lt;- color class(object) &lt;- c(&quot;colored_polygon&quot;, class(object)) object } pinkish &lt;- new_colored_polygon(list(c(0, 0), c(1, 0), c(1, 1)), &quot;triangle&quot;, &quot;roseate&quot;) class(pinkish) [1] &quot;colored_polygon&quot; &quot;polygon&quot; toString(pinkish) [1] &quot;triangle: &lt;0, 0&gt;, &lt;1, 0&gt;, &lt;1, 1&gt;&quot; So far so good: since we have not defined a method to handle colored polygons specifically, we get the behavior for a regular polygon. Let’s add another method that supplements the behavior of the existing method: toString.colored_polygon &lt;- function(poly) { paste0(toString.polygon(poly), &quot;+ color = &quot;, attr(poly, &quot;color&quot;)) } toString(pinkish) [1] &quot;triangle: &lt;0, 0&gt;, &lt;1, 0&gt;, &lt;1, 1&gt;+ color = roseate&quot; In practice, we will almost always place all of the methods associated with a class in the same file as its constructor, validator, and helper. The time has finally come for us to explore projects and packages. 9.6 Key Points S3 is the most commonly used object-oriented programming system in R. Every object can store metadata about itself in attributes, which are set and queried with attr. The dim attribute stores the dimensions of a matrix (which is physically stored as a vector). The class attribute of an object defines its class or classes (it may have several character entries). When F(X, ...) is called, and X has class C, R looks for a function called F.C (the . is just a naming convention). If an object has multiple classes in its class attribute, R looks for a corresponding method for each in turn. Every user defined class C should have functions new_C (to create it), validate_C (to validate its integrity), and C (to create and validate). "],

Describe and use ., .x, .y,..1,..2`, and other convenience parameters. Define copy-on-modify and explain its use in R. We have accumulated some intellectual debt in the previous lessons, and we should clear this burden from our conscience before we go on to new topics. 10.3 Why shouldn’t I use setwd? Because reasons. But… No. Use the here package instead to create paths that are relative to your current location: print(glue(&#39;here by itself: {here()}&#39;)) here by itself: /Users/gvwilson/tidynomicon print(glue(&#39;here(&quot;book.bib&quot;): {here(&quot;book.bib&quot;)}&#39;)) here(&quot;book.bib&quot;): /Users/gvwilson/tidynomicon/book.bib print(glue(&#39;here(&quot;etc&quot;, &quot;common.R&quot;): {here(&quot;etc&quot;, &quot;common.R&quot;)}&#39;)) here(&quot;etc&quot;, &quot;common.R&quot;): /Users/gvwilson/tidynomicon/etc/common.R 10.4 What the hell are factors? Another feature of R that doesn’t have an exact analog in Python is factors. In statistics, a factor is a categorical variable such as “flavor”, which can be “vanilla”, “chocolate”, “strawberry”, or “mustard”. Factors can be represented as strings, but storing the same string many times wastes space and is inefficient (since comparing strings takes longer than comparing numbers). R therefore stores each string once and gives it with a numeric key, so that internally, “mustard” is the number 4 in the lookup table for “flavor”, but is presented as “mustard” rather than 4. This is useful, but brings with it some problems: On the statistical side, it encourages people to put messy reality into tidy but misleading boxes. For example, it’s unfortunately still common for forms to require people to identify themselves as either “male” or “female”, which is scientifically incorrect. Similarly, census forms that ask questions about racial or ethnic identity often leave people scratching their heads, since they don’t belong to any of the categories offered. On the computational side, some functions in R automatically convert strings to factors by default. This makes sense when working with statistical data—in most cases, a column in which the same strings are repeated many times is categorical—but it is usually not the right choice in other situations. This has surprised enough people the years that the tidyverse goes the other way and only creates factors when asked to. Let’s work through a small example. Suppose we’ve read a CSV file and wound up with this table: raw &lt;- tribble( ~person, ~flavor, ~ranking, &quot;Lhawang&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Lhawang&quot;, &quot;chocolate&quot;, 2.5, &quot;Lhawang&quot;, &quot;mustard&quot;, 0.2, &quot;Khadee&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, 2.1, &quot;Khadee&quot;, &quot;chocolate&quot;, 2.4, &quot;Khadee&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;, 3.9, &quot;Haddad&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, 1.8, &quot;Haddad&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;, 2.1 ) raw # A tibble: 8 x 3 person flavor ranking &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Lhawang strawberry 1.7 2 Lhawang chocolate 2.5 3 Lhawang mustard 0.2 4 Khadee strawberry 2.1 5 Khadee chocolate 2.4 6 Khadee vanilla 3.9 7 Haddad strawberry 1.8 8 Haddad vanilla 2.1 Let’s aggregate using flavor values so that we can check our factor-based aggregating later: raw %&gt;% group_by(flavor) %&gt;% summarize(number = n(), average = mean(ranking)) # A tibble: 4 x 3 flavor number average &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 chocolate 2 2.45 2 mustard 1 0.2 3 strawberry 3 1.87 4 vanilla 2 3 It probably doesn’t make sense to turn person into factors, since names are actually character strings, but flavor is a good candidate: raw &lt;- mutate_at(raw, vars(flavor), as.factor) raw # A tibble: 8 x 3 person flavor ranking &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Lhawang strawberry 1.7 2 Lhawang chocolate 2.5 3 Lhawang mustard 0.2 4 Khadee strawberry 2.1 5 Khadee chocolate 2.4 6 Khadee vanilla 3.9 7 Haddad strawberry 1.8 8 Haddad vanilla 2.1 We can still aggregate as we did before: raw %&gt;% group_by(flavor) %&gt;% summarize(number = n(), average = mean(ranking)) # A tibble: 4 x 3 flavor number average &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 chocolate 2 2.45 2 mustard 1 0.2 3 strawberry 3 1.87 4 vanilla 2 3 We can also impose an ordering on the factor’s elements: raw &lt;- raw %&gt;% mutate(flavor = fct_relevel(flavor, &quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;, &quot;mustard&quot;)) raw # A tibble: 8 x 3 person flavor ranking &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Lhawang strawberry 1.7 2 Lhawang chocolate 2.5 3 Lhawang mustard 0.2 4 Khadee strawberry 2.1 5 Khadee chocolate 2.4 6 Khadee vanilla 3.9 7 Haddad strawberry 1.8 8 Haddad vanilla 2.1 This changes the order in which they are displayed after grouping: raw %&gt;% group_by(flavor) %&gt;% summarize(number = n(), average = mean(ranking)) # A tibble: 4 x 3 flavor number average &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 chocolate 2 2.45 2 strawberry 3 1.87 3 vanilla 2 3 4 mustard 1 0.2 And also changes the order of bars in a bar chart: raw %&gt;% group_by(flavor) %&gt;% summarize(number = n(), average = mean(ranking)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = flavor, y = average)) To learn more about how factors work and how to use them when analyzing categorical data, please see this paper by McNamara and Horton. 10.5 How do I refer to various arguments in a pipeline? When we put a function in a pipeline using %&gt;%, that operator calls the function with the incoming data as the first argument, so data %&gt;% func(arg) is the same as func(data, arg). This is fine when we want the incoming data to be the first argument, but what if we want it to be second? Or third? One possibility is to save the result so far in a temporary variable and then start a second pipe: data &lt;- tribble( ~left, ~right, 1, NA, 2, 20 ) empties &lt;- data %&gt;% pmap_lgl(function(...) { args &lt;- list(...) any(is.na(args)) }) data %&gt;% transmute(id = row_number()) %&gt;% filter(empties) %&gt;% pull(id) [1] 1 This builds a logical vector empties with as many entries as data has rows, then filters data according to which of the entries in the vector are TRUE. A better practice is to use the parameter name ., which means “the incoming data”. In some functions (e.g., a two-argument function being used in map) we can also use .x and .y for the first and second arguments, and for more arguments, we can use ..1, ..2, and so on (with two dots at the front): data %&gt;% pmap_lgl(function(...) { args &lt;- list(...) any(is.na(args)) }) %&gt;% tibble(empty = .) %&gt;% mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;% filter(empty) %&gt;% pull(id) [1] 1 In this model, we create the logical vector, then turn it into a tibble with one column called empty (which is what empty = . does in tibble’s constructor). After that, we add another column with row numbers, filter, and pull out the row numbers. And while we’re here: row_number doesn’t do what its name suggests. We’re better off using rowid_to_column: data %&gt;% rowid_to_column() # A tibble: 2 x 3 rowid left right &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 1 NA 2 2 2 20 10.6 How does R give the appearance of immutable data? Another feature of R that can surprise the unwary is its use of copy-on-modify to make data appear immutable (a jargon term meaning “cannot be changed after creation”). If two or more variables refer to the same data and that data is updated via one variable, R automatically makes a copy of the data so that the other variable’s value doesn’t change. Here’s a simple example: first &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) second &lt;- first print(glue(&quot;before modification, first is {paste(first, collapse=&#39;-&#39;)} and second is {paste(second, collapse=&#39;-&#39;)}&quot;)) before modification, first is red-green-blue and second is red-green-blue first[[1]] &lt;- &quot;sulphurous&quot; print(glue(&quot;after modification, first is {paste(first, collapse=&#39;-&#39;)} and second is {paste(second, collapse=&#39;-&#39;)}&quot;)) after modification, first is sulphurous-green-blue and second is red-green-blue This is true of nested structures as well: first &lt;- tribble( ~left, ~right, 101, 202, 303, 404) second &lt;- first first$left[[1]] &lt;- 999 print(&quot;first after modification&quot;) [1] &quot;first after modification&quot; first # A tibble: 2 x 2 left right &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 999 202 2 303 404 print(&quot;second after modification&quot;) [1] &quot;second after modification&quot; second # A tibble: 2 x 2 left right &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 101 202 2 303 404 In this case, the entire left column of first has been replaced: tibbles (and data frames) are stored as lists of vectors, so changing any value in a column triggers construction of a new column vector. We can watch this happen using the tracemem function, which shows us where objects live in the computer’s memory: first &lt;- tribble( ~left, ~right, 101, 202, 303, 404 ) tracemem(first) [1] &quot;&lt;0x7fbb883f1208&gt;&quot; first$left[[1]] &lt;- 999 tracemem[0x7fbb883f1208 -&gt; 0x7fbb87f4abc8]: eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers handle timing_fn evaluate_call &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir block_exec call_block process_group.block process_group withCallingHandlers process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; do.call eval eval eval eval eval.parent local tracemem[0x7fbb87f4abc8 -&gt; 0x7fbb87f4ab48]: eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers handle timing_fn evaluate_call &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir block_exec call_block process_group.block process_group withCallingHandlers process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; do.call eval eval eval eval eval.parent local tracemem[0x7fbb87f4ab48 -&gt; 0x7fbb87f4aac8]: $&lt;-.data.frame $&lt;- eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers handle timing_fn evaluate_call &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir block_exec call_block process_group.block process_group withCallingHandlers process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; do.call eval eval eval eval eval.parent local tracemem[0x7fbb87f4aac8 -&gt; 0x7fbb87f4aa88]: $&lt;-.data.frame $&lt;- eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers handle timing_fn evaluate_call &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir block_exec call_block process_group.block process_group withCallingHandlers process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; do.call eval eval eval eval eval.parent local untracemem(first) This rather cryptic output tell us the address of the tibble, then notifies us of changes to the tibble and its contents. We can accomplish something a little more readable using pryr::address (i.e., the address function from the pryr package): left &lt;- first$left # alias print(glue(&quot;left column is initially at {pryr::address(left)}&quot;)) left column is initially at 0x7fbb87f4ab88 first$left[[2]] &lt;- 888 print(glue(&quot;after modification, the original column is still at {pryr::address(left)}&quot;)) after modification, the original column is still at 0x7fbb87f4ab88 temp &lt;- first$left # another alias print(glue(&quot;but the first column is at {pryr::address(temp)}&quot;)) but the first column is at 0x7fbb884d58c8 (We need to use the alias temp because address(first$left) doesn’t work: the argument to address needs to be a variable name.) R’s copy-on-modify semantics is particularly important when writing functions. If we modify an argument inside a function, that modification isn’t visible to the caller, so even functions that appear to modify structures usually don’t. (“Usually”, because there are exceptions, but we must stray off the path to find them.) 10.7 What else should I worry about? Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” Here, then, are few of the hobgoblins I’ve encountered on my journey through R. 10.7.1 The order function The function order generates indices to pull values into place rather than push them, i.e., order(x)[i] is the index in x of the element that belongs at location i. For example: bases &lt;- c(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) order(bases) [1] 4 2 1 3 shows that the value at location 4 (the \"a\") belongs in the first spot of the vector; it does not mean that the value in the first location (the \"g\") belongs in location 4. This convention means that something[order(something)] does the right thing: bases[order(bases)] [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;t&quot; 10.7.2 One of a set of values The function one_of is a handy way to specify several values for matching without complicated Boolean conditionals. For example, gather(data, key = \"year\", value = \"cases\", one_of(c(\"1999\", \"2000\"))) collects data for the years 1999 and 2000. 10.7.3 | and &amp; are not the same as || and &amp;&amp; Let’s try some experiments: TRUE_TRUE &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE) TRUE_FALSE &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE) FALSE_TRUE &lt;- c(FALSE, TRUE) print(glue(&quot;TRUE_TRUE &amp; TRUE_FALSE: {paste(TRUE_TRUE &amp; TRUE_FALSE, collapse = &#39; &#39;)}&quot;)) TRUE_TRUE &amp; TRUE_FALSE: TRUE FALSE print(glue(&quot;TRUE_TRUE &amp; FALSE_TRUE: {paste(TRUE_TRUE &amp; FALSE_TRUE, collapse = &#39; &#39;)}&quot;)) TRUE_TRUE &amp; FALSE_TRUE: FALSE TRUE print(glue(&quot;TRUE_TRUE &amp;&amp; TRUE_FALSE: {paste(TRUE_TRUE &amp;&amp; TRUE_FALSE, collapse = &#39; &#39;)}&quot;)) TRUE_TRUE &amp;&amp; TRUE_FALSE: TRUE print(glue(&quot;TRUE_TRUE &amp;&amp; FALSE_TRUE: {paste(TRUE_TRUE &amp;&amp; FALSE_TRUE, collapse = &#39; &#39;)}&quot;)) TRUE_TRUE &amp;&amp; FALSE_TRUE: FALSE The difference is that &amp; always returns a vector result after doing element-by-element conjunction, while &amp;&amp; returns a scalar result. This means that &amp; is almost always what we want to use when working with data. 10.7.4 Functions and columns There is a function called n. It’s not the same thing as a column called n. I only made this mistake a dozen times. data &lt;- tribble( ~a, ~n, 1, 10, 2, 20 ) data %&gt;% summarize(total = sum(n)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 total &lt;dbl&gt; 1 30 data %&gt;% summarize(total = sum(n())) # A tibble: 1 x 1 total &lt;int&gt; 1 2 10.8 Key Points Don’t use setwd. The formula operator ~ delays evaluation of its operand or operands. ~ was created to allow users to pass formulas into functions, but is used more generally to delay evaluation. Some tidyverse functions define . to be the whole data, .x and .y to be the first and second arguments, and ..N to be the N’th argument. These convenience parameters are primarily used when the data being passed to a pipelined function needs to go somewhere other than in the first parameter’s slot. ‘Copy-on-modify’ means that data is aliased until something attempts to modify it, at which point it duplicated, so that data always appears to be unchanged.

What can go in an R package? How are R packages distributed? What data formats can be used in an R package? How should I document an R package? 12.2 Learning Objectives Describe the three things an R package can contain. Explain how R code in a package is distributed and one implication of this. Explain the purpose of the DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE and .Rbuildignore files in an R project. Explain what should be put in the R, data, man, and tests directories of an R project. Describe and use specially-formatted comments with roxygen2 to document a package. Use @export and @import directives correctly in roxygen2 documentation. Add a dataset to an R package. Use functions from external libraries inside a package in a hygienic way. Rewrite references to bare column names to satisfy R’s packaging checks. Correctly document the package as a whole and the datasets it contains. Mistakes were made in the previous tutorial. It would be hubris to believe that we will not make more as we continue to clean this data. What will guide us safely through these dark caverns and back into the light of day? The answer is testing. We must test our assumptions, test our code, test our very being if we are to advance. Luckily for us, R provides tools for this purpose not unlike those available in Python. In order to use them, we must first venture into the greater realm of packaging in R. 12.3 What’s in an R package? Unlike Python, with its confusing plethora of packaging tools, R has one way to do it. Before converting our project into a package, we will explore what a package should contain. The text file DESCRIPTION (with no suffix) holds most of the package’s metadata, including a description of what it, who wrote it, and what other packages it requires to run. We will edit its contents as we go along. NAMESPACE, whose name also has no extension, contains the names of everything exported from the package (i.e., everything that is visible to the outside world). As we will see, we should leave its management in the hands of RStudio. Just as .gitignore tells Git what files in a project to ignore, .Rbuildignore tells RStudio which files it doesn’t need to worry about when building a package from source. All of the R source for our package must go in a directory called R; sub-directories are not allowed. As you would expect from its name, the data directory contains all the data in our package. In order for it to be loadable as part of the package, the data must be saved in .rda format. We can use R’s function save to do this (and use load in our code to restore it), but a better choice is to load the usethis library and call usethis::use_data(object, overwrite = TRUE). Manual pages go in the man directory. The bad news is that they have to be in a sort-of-LaTeX format that is only a bit less obscure than the runes inscribed on the ancient dagger your colleague brought back from her latest archeological dig. The good news is, we can embed comments in our source code and use a tool called roxygen2 to extract them and format them as required. The tests directory holds the package’s unit tests. It should contain files with names like test_some_feature.R, which should in turn contain functions named test_something_specific. We’ll have a closer look at these later. In order to understand the rest of what follows, it’s important to understand that R packages are distributed as compiled bytecode, not as source code (which is how Python does it). When a package is built, R loads and checks the code, then saves the corresponding instructions. Our R files should therefore define functions, not run commands immediately, because if they do the latter, those commands will be executed every time the script loads, which is probably not what users will want. As a side effect, this means that if a package uses load(something), then that load command is executed while the package is being compiled, and not while the compiled package is being loaded by a user after distribution. Thus, this simple and rather pointless “package”: library(stringr) sr &lt;- function(text, pattern, replacement) { str_replace(text, pattern, replacement) } probably won’t work when it’s loaded by a user, because stringr may not be in memory on the user’s machine at the time str_replace is called. How then can our packages use libraries? The safest way is to use fully-qualified names such as stringr::str_replace every time we call a function defined somewhere outside our package. We will explore other options below. And while we’re hedging the statements we have already made: Data that isn’t meant to be loaded directly into are should go in inst/extdata. The first part of the directory name, inst, is short for “install”: when the package is installed, everything in this directory is bumped up a level and put in the installation directory. Thus, the installation directory will get a sub-directory called extdata (for “external data”), and that can hold whatever we want. We should always put LazyData: TRUE in DESCRIPTION so that datasets are only loaded on demand. 12.4 How do I create a package? We cannot turn this tutorial into an R package because we’re building it as a website, not as a package. Instead, we will create an R package called unicefdata to hold cleaned-up copies of some HIV/AIDS data and maternal health data from UNICEF. The first step is to run RStudio’s project creation wizard. We will create unicefdata directly under our home directory, make it a Git repository, and turn on Packrat (a package manager for R): Figure 12.1: RStudio Project Creation Wizard Before doing our first commit to version control, we remove R/hello.R and man/hello.Rd (which the project wizard helpfully provides as starting points), and add README.md, LICENSE.md, CONDUCT.md, and CITATION.md to describe the project as a whole, its license, the contributor code of conduct, and how we want the project cited. These files are nothing to do with R per se (and as we’ll see below, R isn’t entirely happy having them here with these names), but every project should have all four of these somewhere. After committing all of this to version control, we copy the data tidying script we wrote previous into R/tidy_datasets.R. For reference, this is what the file looks like at this point: library(tidyverse) # Constants. raw_filename &lt;- &quot;inst/extdata/infant_hiv.csv&quot; tidy_filename &lt;- &quot;/tmp/infant_hiv.csv&quot; first_year &lt;- 2009 last_year &lt;- 2017 num_rows &lt;- 192 # Get and clean percentages. raw &lt;- read_csv(raw_filename, skip = 2, na = c(&quot;-&quot;)) raw$ISO3[raw$Countries == &quot;Kosovo&quot;] &lt;- &quot;UNK&quot; sliced &lt;- slice(raw, 1:num_rows) countries &lt;- sliced$ISO3 percents &lt;- sliced %&gt;% select(-ISO3, -Countries) %&gt;% map_dfr(str_replace, pattern = &quot;&gt;?(\\\\d+)%&quot;, replacement = &quot;\\\\1&quot;) %&gt;% map_dfr(function(col) as.numeric(col) / 100) # Separate three-column chunks and add countries and years. num_years &lt;- (last_year - first_year) + 1 chunks &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, num_years) for (year in 1:num_years) { start = 3 * (year - 1) + 1 chunks[[year]] &lt;- select(percents, start:(start + 2)) %&gt;% rename(estimate = 1, hi = 2, lo = 3) %&gt;% mutate(country = countries, year = rep((first_year + year) - 1, num_rows)) %&gt;% select(country, year, everything()) } # Combine chunks and order by country and year. tidy &lt;- bind_rows(chunks) %&gt;% arrange(country, year) # Check. write_csv(tidy, tidy_filename) We’re going to need to wrap this up as a function so that these commands aren’t executed while the library loads, and we should probably also allow the user to specify the locations of the input and output files—we’ll come back and do all of this later. First, though, let’s edit DESCRIPTION and: change the Title, Author, Maintainer, and Description; change the License to MIT (see Choose a License for other options); and go to the Build tab in RStudio and run ’Check` to see if our package meets CRAN’s standards. A note on this: CRAN is the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Like the Python Package Index, it is the place to go to find the packages you need. CRAN’s rules are famously strict, which ensures that packages run for everyone, but which also makes package development a little more onerous than it might be. For example, when we run Check, we get this: * checking top-level files ... NOTE Non-standard files/directories found at top level: &#39;CITATION.md&#39; &#39;CONDUCT.md&#39; &#39;LICENSE.md&#39; ... Found the following CITATION file in a non-standard place: CITATION.md Most likely &#39;inst/CITATION&#39; should be used instead. After a bit of searching online, we rearrange these files as follows: LICENSE.md becomes LICENSE with no extension (but still in the root directory). The DESCRIPTION entry for the license is updated to License: MIT + file LICENSE (spelled exactly that way). We add lines to .Rbuildignore to tell R to ignore CITATION.md and CONDUCT.md. We could instead move CITATION.md to inst/CITATION so that it will be copied into the root of the installation directory on users’ machines, but a lot of people expect to find the citation description in the root directory of the original project. We could also duplicate the file, and once the package is mature enough to deploy, that might be the best answer. These changes fix the warnings about non-standard files in non-standard places, but we are far from done—we also have this to deal with: checking for missing documentation entries ... WARNING Undocumented code objects: &#39;tidy_infant_hiv&#39; All user-level objects in a package should have documentation entries. Fair enough—we want people to know what our package is for and how to use it, so a little documentation seems like a fair request. For this, we turn to Hadley Wickham’s R Packages and Karl Broman’s “R package primer” for advice on writing roxygen2 documentation. We then return to our source file and wrap our existing code with this: #&#39; Tidy up the infant HIV data set. #&#39; #&#39; @param src_path path to source file #&#39; #&#39; @return a tibble of tidy data #&#39; #&#39; @export tidy_infant_hiv &lt;- function(src_path) { # ...all the code from before... # Return the final tidy dataset. tidy } roxygen2 processes comment lines that start with #' (hash followed by single quote). Putting a comment block right before a function associates that documentation with that function; here, we are saying that: the function has a single parameter called src_path; it returns a tibble of tidy data; and we want it exported (i.e., we want it to be visible outside the package). Our function is now documented, but when we run Check, we still get a warning. After a bit more searching and experimentation, we discover that we need to load the devtools package and run devtools::document() to regenerate documentation: it isn’t done automatically. When we do this, we get good news and bad news: Updating unicefdata documentation Loading unicefdata First time using roxygen2. Upgrading automatically... Updating roxygen version in /Users/gvwilson/unicefdata/DESCRIPTION Warning: The existing &#39;NAMESPACE&#39; file was not generated by roxygen2, and will not be overwritten. Writing tidy_infant_hiv.Rd Ah—the tutorials did warn us about this. We need to delete NAMESPACE and re-run devtools:document() in order to create this file: # Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand export(tidy_infant_hiv) The comment at the start tells roxygen2 it can overwrite the file, and reminds us that we shouldn’t edit it by hand. The export(tidy_infant_hiv) directive is what we really want: as you might guess, it tells the package builder which function to make visible. After doing this, we go into “Build…More…Configure build tools” and check “Generate documentation with Roxygen”. Running the build again gives us: tidy_infant_hiv: no visible global function definition for &#39;read_csv&#39; tidy_infant_hiv: no visible global function definition for &#39;slice&#39; tidy_infant_hiv: no visible global function definition for &#39;%&gt;%&#39; tidy_infant_hiv: no visible global function definition for &#39;select&#39; ...several more... tidy_infant_hiv: no visible global function definition for &#39;bind_rows&#39; tidy_infant_hiv: no visible global function definition for &#39;arrange&#39; Undefined global functions or variables: %&gt;% Countries ISO3 arrange bind_rows country everything map_dfr mutate read_csv rename select slice str_replace year This is the package loading problem mentioned earlier: since our compiled-and-distributable package will only contain the bytecodes for its own functions, direct calls to functions from other libraries won’t work after the package is installed. We will demonstrate two ways to fix this. First, we can add this to the roxygen2 comment block for our function: #&#39; @import dplyr #&#39; @importFrom magrittr %&gt;% which tells the package builder that we want all of the functions in these two packages available. Second (and more properly) we can change various call to use their package prefix, e.g.: percents &lt;- sliced %&gt;% select(ISO3, Countries) %&gt;% purrr::map_dfr(stringr::str_replace, pattern = &quot;&gt;?(\\\\d+)%&quot;, replacement = &quot;\\\\1&quot;) %&gt;% purrr::map_dfr(function(col) as.numeric(col) / 100) This changes the error to one that is slightly more confusing: * checking package dependencies ... ERROR Namespace dependencies not required: &#39;dplyr&#39; &#39;magrittr&#39; See section &#39;The DESCRIPTION file&#39; in the &#39;Writing R Extensions&#39; manual. * DONE Status: 1 ERROR checking package dependencies ... ERROR Namespace dependencies not required: &#39;dplyr&#39; &#39;magrittr&#39; More searching, more experimentation, and finally we add this to the DESCRIPTION file: Imports: readr (&gt;= 1.1.0), dplyr (&gt;= 0.7.0), magrittr (&gt;= 1.5.0), purrr (&gt;= 0.2.0), rlang (&gt;= 0.3.0), stringr (&gt;= 1.3.0) The Imports field in DESCRIPTION actually has nothing to do with importing functions; it just ensures that those packages are installed when this package is. As for the version numbers in parentheses, we got those by running packageVersion(\"readr\") and similar commands inside RStudio and then rounding off. All right: are we done now? No, we are not: checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE tidy_infant_hiv: no visible binding for global variable &#39;ISO3&#39; tidy_infant_hiv: no visible binding for global variable &#39;Countries&#39; tidy_infant_hiv: no visible binding for global variable &#39;country&#39; tidy_infant_hiv: no visible binding for global variable &#39;year&#39; This is annoying but understandable. When the package builder is checking our code, it has no idea what columns are going to be in our data frames, so it has no way to know if ISO3 or Countries will cause a problem. However, this is just a NOTE, not an ERROR, so we can try running “Build…Install and Restart” to build our package, re-start our R session (so that memory is clean), and load our newly-created package, and then run tidy_infant_hiv(\"inst/extdata/infant_hiv.csv\"). This produces: Error in read_csv(src_path, skip = 2, na = c(&quot;-&quot;)) : could not find function &quot;read_csv&quot; After calling upon the names of Those Who Shall Not Be Named and making a fresh cup of tea, we re-read our code and realize that we forgot to rename read_csv to readr::read_csv. Fixing this doesn’t fix the problem with column names, though; to do that, we add this to the roxygen2 comment block: #&#39; @importFrom rlang .data and then modify the calls that use naked column names to be: select(-.data$ISO3, -.data$Countries) %&gt;% ... select(.data$country, .data$year, everything()) ... arrange(.data$country, .data$year) What is this .data that we have invoked? Typing ?rlang::.data gives us the answer: it is a pronoun that allows us to be explicit when we refer to an object inside the data. Adding this—i.e., being explicity that country is a column of .data rather than an undefined variable—finally (finally) gives us a clean build. But we are not done, because we are never truly done, any more than we are ever truly safe. We still need to add our cleaned-up data to our package and document the package as a whole. There are three steps to this. First, we load and clean the data, storing the cleaned tibble in a variable called infant_hiv, then load the usethis package and called usethis::use_data(infant_hiv) to store the tibble in data/infant_hiv.rda. (We could just call save with the appropriate parameters, but usethis is a useful set of tools for creating and managing R projects, and in retrospect, we should have started using it earlier.) Note: we must save the data as .rda, not as (for example) .rds or .csv; only .rda will be automatically loaded as part of the project. Second, we create a file called R/infant_hiv.R to hold documentation about the dataset and put this in it: #&#39; Tidied infant HIV data. #&#39; #&#39; This tidy data is derived from the `infant_hiv.csv` file, which in turn is #&#39; derived from an Excel spreadsheet provided by UNICEF - see the README.md file #&#39; in the raw data directory for details. #&#39; #&#39; @format A data frame #&#39; \\describe{ #&#39; \\item{country}{Country reporting (ISO3 code)} #&#39; \\item{year}{Year reported} #&#39; \\item{estimate}{Best estimate of rate (may be NA)} #&#39; \\item{hi}{High end of estimate range (may be NA)} #&#39; \\item{lo}{Low end of estimate range (may be NA)} #&#39; } &quot;infant_hiv&quot; Everything except the last line is a roxygen2 comment block that describes the data in plain language, then uses some tags and directives to document its format and fields. (Note that we have also documented our data in inst/extdata/README.md, but that focuses on the format and meaning of the raw data, not the cleaned-up version.) The last line is the string \"infant_hiv\", i.e., the name of the dataset. We will create one placeholder R file like this for each of our datasets, and each will have that dataset’s name as the thing being documented. We use a similar trick to document the package as a whole: we create a file R/unicefdata.R (i.e., a file with exactly the same name as the package) and put this in it: #&#39; Clean up and share some data from UNICEF on infant HIV rates and maternal mortality. #&#39; #&#39; @author Greg Wilson, \\email{greg.wilson@rstudio.com} #&#39; @docType package #&#39; @name unicefdata NULL That’s right: to document the entire package, we document NULL, which is one of the few times R uses call-by-value. (That’s a fairly clumsy joke, but honestly, who among us is at our best at times like these?) 12.5 Key Points An R package can contain code, data, and documentation. R code is distributed as compiled bytecode in packages, not as source. R packages are almost always distributed through CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Most of a project’s metadata goes in a file called DESCRIPTION. Metadata related to imports and exports goes in a file called NAMESPACE. Add patterns to a file called .Rbuildignore to ignore files or directories when building a project. All source code for a package must go in the R sub-directory. library calls in a package’s source code will not be executed as the package is loaded after distribution. Data can be included in a package by putting it in the data sub-directory. Data must be in .rda format in order to be loaded as part of a package. Data in other formats can be put in the inst/extdata directory, and will be installed when the package is installed. Add comments starting with #' to an R file to document functions. Use roxygen2 to extract these comments to create manual pages in the man directory. Use @export directives in roxygen2 comment blocks to make functions visible outside a package. Add required libraries to the Imports section of the DESCRIPTION file to indicate that your package depends on them. Use package::function to access externally-defined functions inside a package. Alternatively, add @import directives to roxygen2 comment blocks to make external functions available inside the package. Import .data from rlang and use .data$column to refer to columns instead of using bare column names. Create a file called R/package.R and document NULL to document the package as a whole. Create a file called R/dataset.R and document the string ‘dataset’ to document a dataset. "],

Explain how element names are used to connect interface elements to server actions. Describe the structure of a simple Shiny application and how to run it. Explain what reactive variables are and how they differ from normal variables. Use functions to create and style HTML elements. Explain how to avoid circular updates in interfaces. Sooner or later, almost every application needs a graphical interface so that users can load data files, control parameters, and view results. While the desktop still has a role to play, the best place to build an interface these days is on the web, and the best toolkit for doing that in R is Shiny. This lesson will walk through the construction of a simple application and along the way introduce you to reactive programming. To follow along, please install Shiny using: install.packages(&quot;shiny&quot;) library(shiny) 13.3 How do I set up a simple application? Every Shiny app has three things: A user interface object that shows things to user. A server function, which is the back end that provides data. A call to shinyApp that binds the two together. These can all live in the same file, but most developers prefer to put the UI and server code in separate files. To start, we will reproduce the first example from the Shiny tutorials. The first step is to create a directory called faithful_app: we must do this because every Shiny application needs to be in its own directory. Inside that directory, create a file called app.R. The function call runApp(directory_name) automatically looks in the named directory for a file with that name. Inside app.R, we can create the skeleton of the application: library(shiny) ui &lt;- # ...user interface... server &lt;- # ...server... shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) Our next tasks are to fill in the user interface and server. 13.4 How do I create a user interface? Our interface is a fluid page, i.e., it resizes as needed based on the size of the browser. It uses a single sidebar layout with two elements, sidebarPanel and mainPanel. The sidebar contains a sliderInput object that (as you’d expect from the name) creates a slider; we must specify label, min, max, and value to set it up. We must also specify a value called inputId; this gives it a name that we can use to refer to it in the server. Our interface also contains a mainPanel object that in turn contains a single plotOutput whose outputId attribute is used to refer to it. The whole thing looks like this: ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;Hello Shiny!&quot;), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( sliderInput(inputId = &quot;bins&quot;, label = &quot;Number of bins:&quot;, min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)), mainPanel(plotOutput(outputId = &quot;distPlot&quot;)) ) ) 13.5 How do I create a server? In any interactive application, something has to react to changes in controls and update displays. Shiny watches for the former and takes care of the latter automatically, but we have to tell it what to watch, what to update, and how to make those updates. We do this by creating a function called server that Shiny calls when it needs to: server &lt;- function(input, output) { output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({ x &lt;- faithful$waiting bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1) hist(x, breaks = bins, col = &quot;#75AADB&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;, xlab = &quot;Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of waiting times&quot;) }) } When there is a change in one of the input elements, Shiny notices and calls our function, giving it inputs (i.e., our controls) and outputs (our displays). For example, input$bins matches the bins ID for the slider, so the value of input$bins will be the value of the slider. Similarly, output$distPlot matches the distPlot ID of the plot, so we can use Shiny’s renderPlot function to tell it what to plot. (We can’t use ggplot2 calls directly, but the terminology is very similar.) In this case: the x axis is waiting times from the faithful data, bins is the bin labels (we use input$bins to get the value), and hist is the histogram we want plotted. 13.6 How do I run my application? We can now run app.R from the command line or use: runApp(&quot;faithful_app&quot;) from inside RStudio. Once the application is running, we can narrow the window to see things automatically resize (the “fluid” part of the interface). 13.7 How can I improve my user interface? Let’s trying building a tool for exploring the UNICEF data we tidied up in earlier lessons. To start, we mkdir unicef/skeleton and create app.R: library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;UNICEF Data&quot;), sidebarLayout( position = &quot;right&quot;, sidebarPanel( img(src = &quot;logo.png&quot;, width = 200), h2(&quot;Controls&quot;) ), mainPanel(h1(&quot;Display&quot;)) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ # Empty for now. } shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/shiny/unicef-skeleton.png&quot;) As the screenshot shows, this positions the controls on the right. We use h1, h2, and similarly-named functions to create HTML elements and img to display a logo. The server is empty for now; when we run it, everything looks good except the image, because it turns out that static images must be in the application’s www folder, i.e., in unicef/skeleton/www. It’s now time to add interactive control elements, better known as widgets. Shiny provides: buttons checkboxes radio buttons pulldown selectors (for cases when checkboxes or radio buttons would take up too much space) date inputs and date ranges filenames sliders (like the one seen before) free-form text input That’s a lot of options; since we don’t have a user to consult, we need to decide what we’re going to visualize. One obvious choice is to allow people to choose a data file, and then select a data range based on the years in that file and see a line plot of the average estimate by year. This makes our interface: ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;UNICEF Data&quot;), sidebarLayout( position = &quot;right&quot;, sidebarPanel( img(src = &quot;logo.png&quot;, width = 200), fileInput(&quot;datafile&quot;, p(&quot;data file&quot;)), dateRangeInput(&quot;years&quot;, p(&quot;years&quot;), format = &quot;yyyy&quot;) ), mainPanel(h1(&quot;Display&quot;)) ) ) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/shiny/unicef-prototype.png&quot;) Let’s show the chosen filename in the output display: ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;UNICEF Data&quot;), sidebarLayout( # ...as before... mainPanel( textOutput(&quot;filename&quot;) ) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$filename &lt;- renderText({ paste(&quot;input file:&quot;, input$datafile) }) } The initial display looks good: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/shiny/unicef-filename-wrong-before.png&quot;) but when we fill in the filename, something is clearly wrong: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/shiny/unicef-filename-wrong-after.png&quot;) A quick browse of the documentation reveals that input is a named list-like object of everything set up in the interface. input$datafile picks out one element, but it turns out that’s a data frame: what we actually want is input$datafile$datapath: server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$filename &lt;- renderText({ paste(&quot;input file:&quot;, input$datafile$datapath) }) } Some more experimentation reveals that we should display name, but use datapath when reading data. Let’s fill in the server a bit: server &lt;- function(input, output){ currentData &lt;- NULL output$filename &lt;- renderText({ currentName &lt;- input$datafile$name currentPath &lt;- input$datafile$datapath if (is.null(currentName)) { currentData &lt;- NULL text &lt;- &quot;no filename set&quot; } else { currentData &lt;- read_csv(currentPath) text &lt;- paste(&quot;showing&quot;, currentName) } text }) } This short server shows that there are three places we can put variables: At the top of the script outside functions, they are run once when the app launches. Inside server, they are run once for each user. Inside a handler like renderText, they are run once on each change. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/shiny/unicef-filename-right.png&quot;) 13.8 How can I display the data in a file? Now comes the hard part: updating the chart when the file changes. The trick is to use a reactive variable, which is actually a function that changes value whenever something it depends on changes. That “something” is usually another reactive, like the ones provided by Shiny. In the code below, currentData is created by calling reactive with a block of code that produces the variable’s value. It uses input$datafile, so it will automatically be triggered whenever input$datafile changes. Other things can depend on it in the same way, which allows us to get rid of currentData: output$filename uses currentData(), so it is automatically called when the reactive variable’s value changes. server &lt;- function(input, output){ currentData &lt;- reactive({ currentPath &lt;- input$datafile$datapath if (is.null(currentPath)) { result &lt;- NULL } else { result &lt;- read_csv(currentPath) } result }) output$filename &lt;- renderText({ currentName &lt;- input$datafile$name if (is.null(currentName)) { text &lt;- &quot;no filename set&quot; } else { text &lt;- paste(&quot;showing&quot;, currentName) } text }) output$chart &lt;- renderPlot({ data &lt;- currentData() if (is.null(data)) { message(&quot;no data&quot;) chart &lt;- NULL } else { message(&quot;we have data, creating chart&quot;) chart &lt;- data %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(average = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average)) } chart }) } 13.9 How can I break circular dependencies? Now comes the other hard part: handling changes to the date range. We want the chart to display data for the selected range of years and have the minimum and maximum possible year set by the data. That means we have to change something in the user interface from the server; to do that, we add a third parameter session to the server function. This variable holds the backward connection from the server to the UI. Inside our server, we get the current years from input$years and use updateDateRangeInput to push a change from the output function to the input controls. (This is the part that needs session.) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ # ...other code as before... output$chart &lt;- renderPlot({ years &lt;- input$years message(&#39;years&#39;, years) data &lt;- currentData() if (is.null(data)) { chart &lt;- NULL } else { minYear &lt;- as.character(min(data$year)) maxYear &lt;- as.character(max(data$year)) updateDateRangeInput(session, &quot;years&quot;, min = minYear, max = maxYear, start = minYear, end = maxYear) chart &lt;- data %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(average = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average)) + ggtitle(paste(&quot;Years&quot;, minYear, &quot;-&quot;, maxYear)) } chart }) } When we run this, it displays the current date twice on startup before a file is selected because that’s the default for the date input. Once dates are entered, though, it goes into an infinite loop because ghe chart depends on the dates, but we’re changing the dates inside the plot update. Let’s try again. We will just read years inside the chart update and display it: output$chart &lt;- renderPlot({ years &lt;- input$years message(&#39;years&#39;, years) data &lt;- currentData() if (is.null(data)) { chart &lt;- NULL } else { minYear &lt;- as.character(min(data$year)) maxYear &lt;- as.character(max(data$year)) chart &lt;- data %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(average = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average)) + ggtitle(paste(&quot;Years&quot;, minYear, &quot;-&quot;, maxYear)) } chart }) Whoops: the message appears every time a character is typed in one of the date controls, i.e., deleting the start year and typing 2, 0, 1, 8 produces 0002, 0020, and 0201 before producing a usable year. That’s clearly not what we want, so we’ll try a third approach and only show the year selector when there’s data. While we’re doing this, we’ll change the year selector to a double-ended slider, because seeing the day and month is misleading. The revised UI code looks like this: ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;UNICEF Data&quot;), sidebarLayout( position = &quot;right&quot;, sidebarPanel( img(src = &quot;logo.png&quot;, width = 200), div( id = &quot;datafileInput&quot;, fileInput(&quot;datafile&quot;, p(&quot;data file&quot;)) ) ), mainPanel( p(textOutput(&quot;filename&quot;)), plotOutput(&quot;chart&quot;) ) ) ) Here, we have wrapped the file selector in a div so that we have a named element after which to insert our date range selector, but haven’t included the date range selector (yet). The outline of the corresponding server is: server &lt;- function(input, output){ currentData &lt;- reactive({ # ...provide currentData... }) selectedData &lt;- reactive({ # ...provide selectedData... }) observeEvent(input$datafile, { # ...insert year selector when datafile changes... }) output$chart &lt;- renderPlot({ # ...update chart when selectedData changes... }) output$filename &lt;- renderText({ # ...update displayed filename when selected file changes... }) } The zero’th change is getting rid of the session variable: we don’t need it any longer because we’re not modifying the interface from the server. The first change is to create a reactive variable for the selected data. We need this because the chart depends on the selected data, while the range of years we can select depends on the current (actual) data. As a rule, everywhere we might need to “see” data, we should create a reactive variable. The function observeEvent allows us to create event handlers that aren’t directly attached to display objects; we need one so that we can create the year display. Once that’s set up, currentData is straightforward: if the filename changes, load that CSV file: currentData &lt;- reactive({ read_csv(input$datafile$datapath) }) selectedData is also straightforward: if currentData changes, filter by year range: selectedData &lt;- reactive({ req(input$years) currentData() %&gt;% filter(between(year, input$years[1], input$years[2])) }) This function uses currentData() so that Shiny knows it depends on changes to the current data. But how do we know we have a year range? The answer is that req(input$years) means “make sure this thing exists before going any further”. Once we have the years, we can filter as required. Now for the clever bit: we will create a slider after loading a data file. More specifically, we will use observeEvent(input$datafile, {...}) to indicate that this action depends on changes to the filename, then get the current data, grab the year range, create a sliderInput, and use insertUI to add it after the div we created: observeEvent(input$datafile, { current &lt;- currentData() lowYear &lt;- min(current$year) highYear &lt;- max(current$year) insertUI( selector = &quot;#datafileInput&quot;, where = &quot;afterEnd&quot;, ui = sliderInput(&quot;years&quot;, &quot;years&quot;, min = lowYear, max = highYear, value = c(lowYear, highYear), sep = &quot;&quot;) ) }) Creating the chart and displaying the filename is done as before, though we have switched to ifelse for the filename’s value to be idiomatic. Note that the chart depends on selectedData() and not the raw data: output$chart &lt;- renderPlot({ selectedData() %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(average = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average)) + labs(title = paste(&quot;Years&quot;, input$years[1], &quot;to&quot;, input$years[2])) }) output$filename &lt;- renderText({ currentName &lt;- input$datafile$name ifelse(is.null(currentName), &quot;no filename set&quot;, paste(&quot;showing&quot;, currentName)) }) Here are the dependencies we have created: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/shiny/unicef-slider-dependencies.png&quot;) It works! Except that we’re adding a slider every time we open a file, so if we open the same file twice, we get two sliders with identical ranges: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/shiny/unicef-slider.png&quot;) 13.10 How can I control how the user interface is rendered? Our last refinement uses uiOutput and renderUI to (re-)create the slider at just the right moment. The UI looks familiar, except there’s a uiOutput placeholder where the slider is to go—its name “slider” will be used in the server: ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;UNICEF Data&quot;), sidebarLayout( position = &quot;right&quot;, sidebarPanel( img(src = &quot;logo.png&quot;, width = 200), fileInput(&quot;datafile&quot;, p(&quot;data file&quot;)), uiOutput(&quot;slider&quot;) ), mainPanel( p(textOutput(&quot;filename&quot;)), plotOutput(&quot;chart&quot;) ) ) ) uiOutput is always used in conjunction with renderUI in the server, so let’s look at the server: server &lt;- function(input, output){ currentData &lt;- reactive({ # ...get the data... }) output$slider &lt;- renderUI({ # ...create a widget to allow year selection... }) selectedData &lt;- reactive({ # ...select data using values from the year selector... }) output$chart &lt;- renderPlot({ # ...draw the chart... }) output$filename &lt;- renderText({ # ...display the filename... }) } What does currentData look like? currentData &lt;- reactive({ req(input$datafile) read_csv(input$datafile$datapath) }) We use req(...) to tell Shiny that there’s no point proceeding unless input$datafile actually has a value, because we can’t load data if we have a NULL filename. Once we have data, we create a slider or overwrite the existing slider if there already is one; this prevents the problem of multiple sliders. Note that the slider’s ID is \"years\" and that its range is set based on data, so we avoid the problem of having to create a slider when we don’t know what its range should be: output$slider &lt;- renderUI({ current &lt;- currentData() lowYear &lt;- min(current$year) highYear &lt;- max(current$year) sliderInput(&quot;years&quot;, &quot;years&quot;, min = lowYear, max = highYear, value = c(lowYear, highYear), sep = &quot;&quot;) }) Once we have a slider, we select the data; this depends on the years from the slider, so we make that explicit using req: selectedData &lt;- reactive({ req(input$years) currentData() %&gt;% filter(between(year, input$years[1], input$years[2])) }) Displaying the chart and the filename are exactly as we’ve seen before: the chart depends on selectedData and the filename display depends on input$datafile$name. So how and why does this all work? When the UI is initially created: There is no data file, so req(input$datafile) in the definition of currentData halts. Without currentData, the renderUI call used to create the slider doesn’t proceed. So the UI doesn’t get a slider and doesn’t try to display data it doesn’t have. When a filename is selected for the first time: input$datafile gets a value. So we load data and we can display the filename. currentData now has a meaningful value. So we can create a slider and initialize its limits to the min and max years from the actual data. So selectedData can now be constructed (all of the things it depends on exist). So we can draw the chart. When a new file is selected: input$datafile gets a value. So we load data and display the filenmae. currentData is then re-created. So we replace the slider with a new one whose bounds are set by the new data. And then construct selectedData and draw the chart. This isn’t the only way to build our interface, but the alternatives use more advanced functions like freeze and are harder to debug. The way to get where we want to is to break everything down into single actions, each of which is probably smaller than we might first expect. It takes a bit of practice, but once you’re used to it, you’ll be able to build some powerful tools with just a page or two of code. 13.11 Key Points Every Shiny application has a user interface, a server, and a call to shinyApp that connects them. Every Shiny application must be in its own directory. Images and other static assets must be in that directory’s www sub-directory. The inputId and outputId attributes of UI elements are used to refer to them from the server. Use input$name and output$name in the server to refer to UI elements. Code placed at the top of the script outside functions is run once when the app launches. Code placed inside server is run once for each user. Code placed inside a handler is run once on each change. A reactive variable is a function whose value changes automatically whenever anything it depends on changes. Use reactive({...}) to create a reactive variable explicitly. The server can change UI elements via the session variable. Use uiOutput and renderUI to (re-)create UI elements as needed in order to break circular dependencies. "],
["python.html", "Chapter 14 Using Python 14.1 Questions 14.2 Learning Objectives 14.3 How can I access data across languages? 14.4 How can I call functions across languages? 14.5 Key Points", " Chapter 14 Using Python 14.1 Questions How can I use Python and R together? 14.2 Learning Objectives Use reticulate to share data between R and Python. Use reticulate to call Python functions from R code and vice versa. Run Python scripts directly from R programs. As the previous lessons have shown, you can do a lot with R, but sometimes you might feel a cold, serpentine tug on your soul pulling you back to Python. You can put Python code in RMarkdown documents: print(&quot;Hello R&quot;) Hello R but how can those chunks interact with your R and vice versa? The answer is a package called reticulate that provides two-way communication between Python and R. To use it, run install.packages(\"reticulate\"). By default, it uses the system-default Python: Sys.which(&quot;python&quot;) python &quot;/Users/gvwilson/anaconda3/bin/python&quot; but you can configure it to use different versions, or to use virtualenv or a Conda environment—see the document for details. 14.3 How can I access data across languages? The most common way to use reticulate is to do some calculations in Python and then use the results in R or vice versa. To show how this works, let’s read our infant HIV data into a Pandas data frame: import pandas data = pandas.read_csv(&#39;tidy/infant_hiv.csv&#39;) print(data.head()) country year estimate hi lo 0 AFG 2009 NaN NaN NaN 1 AFG 2010 NaN NaN NaN 2 AFG 2011 NaN NaN NaN 3 AFG 2012 NaN NaN NaN 4 AFG 2013 NaN NaN NaN All of our Python variables are available in our R session as part of the py object, so py$data is our data frame inside a chunk of R code: library(reticulate) head(py$data) country year estimate hi lo 1 AFG 2009 NaN NaN NaN 2 AFG 2010 NaN NaN NaN 3 AFG 2011 NaN NaN NaN 4 AFG 2012 NaN NaN NaN 5 AFG 2013 NaN NaN NaN 6 AFG 2014 NaN NaN NaN reticulate handles type conversions automatically, though there are a few tricky cases: for example, the number 9 is a float in R, so if you want an integer in Python, you have to add the trailing L (for “long”) and write it 9L. On the other hand, reticulate translates between 0-based and 1-based indexing. Suppose we create a character vector in R: elements = c(&#39;hydrogen&#39;, &#39;helium&#39;, &#39;lithium&#39;, &#39;beryllium&#39;) Hydrogen is in position 1 in R: elements[1] [1] &quot;hydrogen&quot; but position 0 in Python: print(r.elements[0]) hydrogen Note our use of the object r in our Python code: just py$whatever gives us access to Python objects in R, r.whatever gives us access to R objects in Python. 14.4 How can I call functions across languages? We don’t have to run Python code, store values in a variable, and then access that variable from R: we can call the Python directly (or vice versa). For example, we can use Python’s random number generator in R as follows: pyrand &lt;- import(&quot;random&quot;) pyrand$gauss(0, 1) [1] 0.5345443 (There’s no reason to do this—R’s random number generator is just as strong—but it illustrates the point.) We can also source Python scripts. For example, suppose that countries.py contains this function: #!/usr/bin/env python import pandas as pd def get_countries(filename): data = pd.read_csv(filename) return data.country.unique() We can run that script using source_python: source_python(&#39;countries.py&#39;) There is no output because all the script did was define a function. By default, that function and all other top-level variables defined in the script are now available in R: get_countries(&#39;tidy/infant_hiv.csv&#39;) [1] &quot;AFG&quot; &quot;AGO&quot; &quot;AIA&quot; &quot;ALB&quot; &quot;ARE&quot; &quot;ARG&quot; &quot;ARM&quot; &quot;ATG&quot; &quot;AUS&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AZE&quot; [12] &quot;BDI&quot; &quot;BEL&quot; &quot;BEN&quot; &quot;BFA&quot; &quot;BGD&quot; &quot;BGR&quot; &quot;BHR&quot; &quot;BHS&quot; &quot;BIH&quot; &quot;BLR&quot; &quot;BLZ&quot; [23] &quot;BOL&quot; &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;BRB&quot; &quot;BRN&quot; &quot;BTN&quot; &quot;BWA&quot; &quot;CAF&quot; &quot;CAN&quot; &quot;CHE&quot; &quot;CHL&quot; &quot;CHN&quot; [34] &quot;CIV&quot; &quot;CMR&quot; &quot;COD&quot; &quot;COG&quot; &quot;COK&quot; &quot;COL&quot; &quot;COM&quot; &quot;CPV&quot; &quot;CRI&quot; &quot;CUB&quot; &quot;CYP&quot; [45] &quot;CZE&quot; &quot;DEU&quot; &quot;DJI&quot; &quot;DMA&quot; &quot;DNK&quot; &quot;DOM&quot; &quot;DZA&quot; &quot;ECU&quot; &quot;EGY&quot; &quot;ERI&quot; &quot;ESP&quot; [56] &quot;EST&quot; &quot;ETH&quot; &quot;FIN&quot; &quot;FJI&quot; &quot;FRA&quot; &quot;FSM&quot; &quot;GAB&quot; &quot;GBR&quot; &quot;GEO&quot; &quot;GHA&quot; &quot;GIN&quot; [67] &quot;GMB&quot; &quot;GNB&quot; &quot;GNQ&quot; &quot;GRC&quot; &quot;GRD&quot; &quot;GTM&quot; &quot;GUY&quot; &quot;HND&quot; &quot;HRV&quot; &quot;HTI&quot; &quot;HUN&quot; [78] &quot;IDN&quot; &quot;IND&quot; &quot;IRL&quot; &quot;IRN&quot; &quot;IRQ&quot; &quot;ISL&quot; &quot;ISR&quot; &quot;ITA&quot; &quot;JAM&quot; &quot;JOR&quot; &quot;JPN&quot; [89] &quot;KAZ&quot; &quot;KEN&quot; &quot;KGZ&quot; &quot;KHM&quot; &quot;KIR&quot; &quot;KNA&quot; &quot;KOR&quot; &quot;LAO&quot; &quot;LBN&quot; &quot;LBR&quot; &quot;LBY&quot; [100] &quot;LCA&quot; &quot;LKA&quot; &quot;LSO&quot; &quot;LTU&quot; &quot;LUX&quot; &quot;LVA&quot; &quot;MAR&quot; &quot;MDA&quot; &quot;MDG&quot; &quot;MDV&quot; &quot;MEX&quot; [111] &quot;MHL&quot; &quot;MKD&quot; &quot;MLI&quot; &quot;MLT&quot; &quot;MMR&quot; &quot;MNE&quot; &quot;MNG&quot; &quot;MOZ&quot; &quot;MRT&quot; &quot;MUS&quot; &quot;MWI&quot; [122] &quot;MYS&quot; &quot;NAM&quot; &quot;NER&quot; &quot;NGA&quot; &quot;NIC&quot; &quot;NIU&quot; &quot;NLD&quot; &quot;NOR&quot; &quot;NPL&quot; &quot;NRU&quot; &quot;NZL&quot; [133] &quot;OMN&quot; &quot;PAK&quot; &quot;PAN&quot; &quot;PER&quot; &quot;PHL&quot; &quot;PLW&quot; &quot;PNG&quot; &quot;POL&quot; &quot;PRK&quot; &quot;PRT&quot; &quot;PRY&quot; [144] &quot;PSE&quot; &quot;ROU&quot; &quot;RUS&quot; &quot;RWA&quot; &quot;SAU&quot; &quot;SDN&quot; &quot;SEN&quot; &quot;SGP&quot; &quot;SLB&quot; &quot;SLE&quot; &quot;SLV&quot; [155] &quot;SOM&quot; &quot;SRB&quot; &quot;SSD&quot; &quot;STP&quot; &quot;SUR&quot; &quot;SVK&quot; &quot;SVN&quot; &quot;SWE&quot; &quot;SWZ&quot; &quot;SYC&quot; &quot;SYR&quot; [166] &quot;TCD&quot; &quot;TGO&quot; &quot;THA&quot; &quot;TJK&quot; &quot;TKM&quot; &quot;TLS&quot; &quot;TON&quot; &quot;TTO&quot; &quot;TUN&quot; &quot;TUR&quot; &quot;TUV&quot; [177] &quot;TZA&quot; &quot;UGA&quot; &quot;UKR&quot; &quot;UNK&quot; &quot;URY&quot; &quot;USA&quot; &quot;UZB&quot; &quot;VCT&quot; &quot;VEN&quot; &quot;VNM&quot; &quot;VUT&quot; [188] &quot;WSM&quot; &quot;YEM&quot; &quot;ZAF&quot; &quot;ZMB&quot; &quot;ZWE&quot; There is one small pothole in this. When the script is run, the special Python variable __name__ is set to '__main__'\"', i.e., the script thinks it is being called from the command line. If it includes a conditional block to handle command-line arguments like this: if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: input_file, output_files = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2:] main(input_file, output_files) then that block will be executed, but will fail because sys.argv won’t include anything. 14.5 Key Points The reticulate library allows R programs to access data in Python programs and vice versa. Use py.whatever to access a top-level Python variable from R. Use r.whatever to access a top-level R definition from Python. R is always indexed from 1 (even in Python) and Python is always indexed from 0 (even in R). Numbers in R are floating point by default, so use a trailing ‘L’ to force a value to be an integer. A Python script run from an R session believes it is the main script, i.e., __name__ is '__main__' inside the Python script. "],

["glossary.html", "E Glossary", " E Glossary Absolute row number the sequential index of a row in a table, regardless of what sections of the table is being displayed. Aggregation to combine many values into one, e.g., by summing a set of numbers or concatenating a set of strings. Alias to have two (or more) references to the same physical data. Anonymous function a function that has not been assigned a name. Anonymous functions are usually quite short, and are usually defined where they are used, e.g., as callbacks. Attribute a name-value pair associated with an object, used to store metadata about the object such as an array’s dimensions. Catch (exception) to accept responsibility for handling an error or other unexpected event. R prefers “handling a condition” to “catching an exception”. Condition an error or other unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of control. See also handle. Constructor (class) a function that creates an object of a particular class. In the S3 object system, constructors are a convention rather than a requirement. Copy-on-modify the practice of creating a new copy of aliased data whenever there is an attempt to modify it so that each reference will believe theirs is the only one. Double square brackets an index enclosed in [[...]], used to return a single value of the underlying type. See also single square brackets. Eager evaluation evaluating an expression as soon as it is formed. Empty vector a vector that contains no elements. Empty vectors have a type such as logical or character, and are not the same as null. Environment a structure that stores a set of variable names and the values they refer to. Error the most severe type of built-in condition in R. Evaluating function a function that takes arguments as values. Most functions are evaluating functions. Evaluation the process of taking a complex expression such as 1+2*3/4 and turning it into a single irreducible value. Exception an object containing information about an error, or the condition that led to the error. R prefers “handling a condition” to “catching an exception”. Filter to choose a set of records according to the values they contain. Fully qualified name an unambiguous name of the form package::thing. Functional programming a style of programming in which functions transform data rather than modifying it. Functional programming relies heavily on higher-order functions. Generic function a collection of functions with similar purpose, each operating on a different class of data. Global environment the environment that holds top-level definitions in R, e.g., those written directly in the interpreter. Group to divide data into subsets according to some criteria while leaving records in a single structure. Handle (a condition) to accept responsibility for handling an error or other unexpected event. R prefers “handling a condition” to “catching an exception”. Helper (class) in S3, a function that constructs and validates an instance of a class. Heterogeneous potentially containing data of different types. Most vectors in R are homogeneous, but lists can be heterogeneous. Higher-order function a function that takes one or more other functions as parameters. Higher-order functions such as map are commonly used in functional programming. Homogeneous containing data of only a single type. Most vectors in R are homogeneous. Hubris excessive pride or self-confidence. See also unit test (lack of). ISO3 country code a three-letter code defined by ISO 3166-1 that identifies a specific country, dependent territory, or other geopolitical entity. Lazy evaluation delaying evaluation of an expression until the value is actually needed (or at least until after the point where it is first encountered). List a vector that can contain values of many different types. List comprehension an expression that generates a new list from an existing one via an implicit loop. Logical indexing to index a vector or other structure with a vector of Booleans, keeping only the values that correspond to true values. Message the least severe type of built-in condition in R. Method an implementation of a generic function that handles objects of a specific class. NA a special value used to represent data that is Not Available. Name collision a situation in which the same name has been used in two different packages which are then used together, leading to ambiguity. Negative selection to specify the elements of a vector or other data structure that aren’t desired by negating their indices. Null a special value used to represent a missing object. NULL is not the same as NA, and neither is the same as an empty vector. Package a collection of code, data, and documentation that can be distributed and re-used. Pipe operator the %&gt;% used to make the output of one function the input of the next. Promise a data structure used to record an unevaluated expression for lazy evaluation. Pull indexing vectorized indexing in which the value at location i in the index vector specifies which element of the source vector is being pulled into that location in the result vector, i.e., result[i] = source[index[i]]. See also push indexing. Push indexing vectorized indexing in which the value at location i in the index vector specifies an element of the result vector that gets the corresponding element of the source vector, i.e., result[index[i]] = source[i]. Push indexing can easily produce gaps and collisions. See also pull indexing. Quosure a data structure containing an unevaluated expression and its environment. Quoting function a function that is passed expressions rather than the values of those expressions. Raise (exception) a way of indicating that something has gone wrong in a program, or that some other unexpected event has occurred. R prefers “signalling a condition” to “raising an exception”. Range expression an expression of the form low:high that is transformed a sequence of consecutive integers. Reactive programming a style of programming in which actions are triggered by external events. Reactive variable a variable whose value is automatically updated when some other value or values change. Recycle to re-use values from a shorter vector in order to generate a sequence of the same length as a longer one. Relative row number the index of a row in a displayed portion of a table, which may or may not be the same as the absolut row number within the table. S3 a framework for object-oriented programming in R. Scalar a single value of a particular type, such as 1 or “a”. Scalars don’t really exist in R; values that appear to be scalars are actually vectors of unit length. Select to choose entire columns from a table by name or location. Setup (testing) code that is automatically run once before each unit test. Signal (a condition) a way of indicating that something has gone wrong in a program, or that some other unexpected event has occurred. R prefers “signalling a condition” to “raising an exception”. Single square brackets an index enclosed in [...], used to select a structure from another structure. See also double square brackets. Storage allocation setting aside a block of memory for future use. Teardown (testing) code that is automatically run once after each unit test. Test fixture the data structures, files, or other artefacts on which a unit test operates. Test runner a software tool that finds and runs unit tests. Tibble a modern replacement for R’s data frame, which stores tabular data in columns and rows, defined and used in the tidyverse. Tidyverse a collection of R packages for operating on tabular data in consistent ways. Unit test a function that tests one aspect or property of a piece of software. Validator (class) a function that checks the consistency of an S3 object. Variable arguments in a function, the ability to take any number of arguments. R uses ... to capture the “extra” arguments. Vector a sequence of values, usually of homogeneous type. Vectors are the fundamental data structure in R; scalars are actually vectors of unit length. Vectorize to write code so that operations are performed on entire vectors, rather than element-by-element within loops. Warning a built-in condition in R of middling severity. Widget an interactive control element in an user interface. "],

Variable names may include letters, digits, ., and _, but . should be avoided, as it sometimes has special meaning. R’s atomic data types include logical, integer, double (also called numeric), and character. R stores collections in homogeneous vectors of atomic types, or in heterogeneous lists. ‘Scalars’ in R are actually vectors of length 1. Vectors and lists are created using the function c(...). Vector indices from 1 to length(vector) select single elements. Negative indices to vectors deselect elements from the result. The index 0 on its own selects no elements, creating a vector or list of length 0. The expression low:high creates the vector of integers from low to high inclusive. Subscripting a vector with a vector of numbers selects the elements at those locations (possibly with repeats). Subscripting a vector with a vector of logicals selects elements where the indexing vector is TRUE. Values from short vectors (such as ‘scalars’) are repeated to match the lengths of longer vectors. The special value NA represents missing values, and (almost all) operations involving NA produce NA. The special values NULL represents a nonexistent vector, which is not the same as a vector of length 0. G.2 Indexing A list is a heterogeneous vector capable of storing values of any type (including other lists). Indexing with [ returns a structure of the same type as the structure being indexed (e.g., returns a list when applied to a list). Indexing with [[ strips away one level of structure (i.e., returns the indicated element without any wrapping). Use list('name' = value, ...) to name the elements of a list. Use either L['name'] or L$name to access elements by name. Use back-quotes around the name with $ notation if the name is not a legal R variable name. Use matrix(values, nrow = N) to create a matrix with N rows containing the given values. Use m[i, j] to get the value at the i’th row and j’th column of a matrix. Use m[i,] to get a vector containing the values in the i’th row of a matrix. Use m[,j] to get a vector containing the values in the j’th column of a matrix. G.3 Control Flow Use for (loop_variable in collection){ ...body... } to create a loop. Use if (expression) { ...body... } else if (expression) { ...body... } else { ...body... } to create conditionals. Expression conditions must have length 1; use any(...) and all(...) to collapse logical vectors to single values. Use function(...arguments...) { ...body... } to create a function. Use variable &lt;- function(…arguments…) { …body… }` to create a function and give it a name. The body of a function can be a single expression or a block in curly braces. The last expression evaluated in a function is returned as its result. Use return(expression) to return a result early from a function. G.4 The Tidyverse install.packages('name') installs packages. library(name) (without quoting the name) loads a package. library(tidyverse) loads the entire collection of tidyverse libraries at once. read_csv(filename) reads CSV files that use the string ‘NA’ to represent missing values. read_csv infers each column’s data types based on the first thousand values it reads. A tibble is the tidyverse’s version of a data frame, which represents tabular data. head(tibble) and tail(tibble) inspect the first and last few rows of a tibble. summary(tibble) displays a summary of a tibble’s structure and values. tibble$column selects a column from a tibble, returning a vector as a result. tibble['column'] selects a column from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result. tibble[,c] selects column c from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result. tibble[r,] selects row r from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result. Use ranges and logical vectors as indices to select multiple rows/columns or specific rows/columns from a tibble. tibble[[c]] selects column c from a tibble, returning a vector as a result. min(...), mean(...), max(...), and std(...) calculates the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of data. These aggregate functions include NAs in their calculations, and so will produce NA if the input data contains any. Use func(data, na.rm = TRUE) to remove NAs from data before calculations are done (but make sure this is statistically justified). filter(tibble, condition) selects rows from a tibble that pass a logical test on their values. arrange(tibble, column) or arrange(desc(column)) arrange rows according to values in a column (the latter in descending order). select(tibble, column, column, ...) selects columns from a tibble. select(tibble, -column) selects out a column from a tibble. mutate(tibble, name = expression, name = expression, ...) adds new columns to a tibble using values from existing columns. group_by(tibble, column, column, ...) groups rows that have the same values in the specified columns. summarize(tibble, name = expression, name = expression) aggregates tibble values (by groups if the rows have been grouped). tibble %&gt;% function(arguments) performs the same operation as function(tibble, arguments). Use %&gt;% to create pipelines in which the left side of each %&gt;% becomes the first argument of the next stage. G.5 Cleaning Up Data Develop data-cleaning scripts one step at a time, checking intermediate results carefully. Use read_csv to read CSV-formatted tabular data into a tibble. Use the skip and na parameters of read_csv to skip rows and interpret certain values as NA. Use str_replace to replace portions of strings that match patterns with new strings. Use is.numeric to test if a value is a number and as.numeric to convert it to a number. Use map to apply a function to every element of a vector in turn. Use map_dfc and map_dfr to map functions across the columns and rows of a tibble. Pre-allocate storage in a list for each result from a loop and fill it in rather than repeatedly extending the list. G.6 Testing and Error Handling Operations signal conditions in R when errors occur. The three built-in levels of conditions are messages, warnings, and errors. Programs can signal these themselves using the functions message, warning, and stop. Operations can be placed in a call to the function try to suppress errors, but this is a bad idea. Operations can be placed in a call to the function tryCatch to handle errors. Use testthat to write unit tests for R. Put unit tests for an R package in the tests/testthat directory. Put tests in files called test_group.R and call them test_something. Use test_dir to run tests from a particular that match a pattern. Write tests for data transformation steps as well as library functions. G.7 Non-Standard Evaluation R uses lazy evaluation: expressions are evaluated when their values are needed, not before. Use expr to create an expression without evaluating it. Use eval to evaluate an expression in the context of some data. Use enquo to create a quosure containing an unevaluated expression and its environment. Use quo_get_expr to get the expression out of a quosure. Use !! to splice the expression in a quosure into a function call. G.8 Object-Oriented Programming S3 is the most commonly used object-oriented programming system in R. Every object can store metadata about itself in attributes, which are set and queried with attr. The dim attribute stores the dimensions of a matrix (which is physically stored as a vector). The class attribute of an object defines its class or classes (it may have several character entries). When F(X, ...) is called, and X has class C, R looks for a function called F.C (the . is just a naming convention). If an object has multiple classes in its class attribute, R looks for a corresponding method for each in turn. Every user defined class C should have functions new_C (to create it), validate_C (to validate its integrity), and C (to create and validate). G.9 Intellectual Debt Don’t use setwd. The formula operator ~ delays evaluation of its operand or operands. ~ was created to allow users to pass formulas into functions, but is used more generally to delay evaluation. Some tidyverse functions define . to be the whole data, .x and .y to be the first and second arguments, and ..N to be the N’th argument. These convenience parameters are primarily used when the data being passed to a pipelined function needs to go somewhere other than in the first parameter’s slot. ‘Copy-on-modify’ means that data is aliased until something attempts to modify it, at which point it duplicated, so that data always appears to be unchanged. G.10 Projects An R package can contain code, data, and documentation. R code is distributed as compiled bytecode in packages, not as source. R packages are almost always distributed through CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Most of a project’s metadata goes in a file called DESCRIPTION. Metadata related to imports and exports goes in a file called NAMESPACE. Add patterns to a file called .Rbuildignore to ignore files or directories when building a project. All source code for a package must go in the R sub-directory. library calls in a package’s source code will not be executed as the package is loaded after distribution. Data can be included in a package by putting it in the data sub-directory. Data must be in .rda format in order to be loaded as part of a package. Data in other formats can be put in the inst/extdata directory, and will be installed when the package is installed. Add comments starting with #' to an R file to document functions. Use roxygen2 to extract these comments to create manual pages in the man directory. Use @export directives in roxygen2 comment blocks to make functions visible outside a package. Add required libraries to the Imports section of the DESCRIPTION file to indicate that your package depends on them. Use package::function to access externally-defined functions inside a package. Alternatively, add @import directives to roxygen2 comment blocks to make external functions available inside the package. Import .data from rlang and use .data$column to refer to columns instead of using bare column names. Create a file called R/package.R and document NULL to document the package as a whole. Create a file called R/dataset.R and document the string ‘dataset’ to document a dataset. G.11 Web Applications with Shiny Every Shiny application has a user interface, a server, and a call to shinyApp that connects them. Every Shiny application must be in its own directory. Images and other static assets must be in that directory’s www sub-directory. The inputId and outputId attributes of UI elements are used to refer to them from the server. Use input$name and output$name in the server to refer to UI elements. Code placed at the top of the script outside functions is run once when the app launches. Code placed inside server is run once for each user. Code placed inside a handler is run once on each change. A reactive variable is a function whose value changes automatically whenever anything it depends on changes. Use reactive({...}) to create a reactive variable explicitly. The server can change UI elements via the session variable. Use uiOutput and renderUI to (re-)create UI elements as needed in order to break circular dependencies. G.12 Reticulate The reticulate library allows R programs to access data in Python programs and vice versa. Use py.whatever to access a top-level Python variable from R. Use r.whatever to access a top-level R definition from Python. R is always indexed from 1 (even in Python) and Python is always indexed from 0 (even in R). Numbers in R are floating point by default, so use a trailing ‘L’ to force a value to be an integer. A Python script run from an R session believes it is the main script, i.e., __name__ is '__main__' inside the Python script. "]
